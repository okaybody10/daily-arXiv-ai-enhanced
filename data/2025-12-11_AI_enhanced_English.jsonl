Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations.

However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer.

However, such approaches critically rely on the assumption that proxy reward models accurately reflect intended supervision, a condition often violated due to annotation noise, bias, or limited coverage. This misalignment can lead to undesirable behaviors, where models optimize for flawed signals rather than true human values. In this paper, we investigate a novel framework to identify and mitigate such misalignment by treating the fine-tuning process as a form of knowledge integration. We focus on detecting instances of proxy-policy conflicts, cases where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy. We argue that such conflicts often signify areas of shared ignorance, where neither the policy nor the reward model possesses sufficient knowledge, making them especially susceptible to misalignment. To this end, we propose two complementary metrics for identifying these conflicts: a localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance measure. Building on this insight, we design an algorithm named Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling (SHF-CAS) that targets high-conflict QA pairs for additional feedback, refining both the reward model and policy efficiently.

To operationalize this, they introduce two metrics: (1) a local Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) that measures disagreement on individual QA pairs, and (2) a global Kendall-Tau distance that measures ranking disagreement between policy and reward model over multiple responses. Using these, they propose SHF-CAS (Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling), an algorithm that samples high-conflict QA pairs for extra human feedback and uses that feedback to jointly refine both the reward model and the policy more efficiently than uniform or random sampling.", "result": "On two LLM alignment benchmarks, training guided by their conflict-aware selection scheme improves alignment metrics compared to baselines that rely on the biased proxy reward without targeted correction. Their method yields better generalization and robustness to reward model bias, showing that focusing human supervision on high-conflict examples is more effective than naive data usage, even when the starting reward model is systematically flawed.", "conclusion": "Proxy-policy conflicts are informative signals of potential misalignment, especially in regions where both policy and reward model lack sufficient knowledge. By quantifying and exploiting these conflicts via PACS and Kendall-Tau-based measures, and by directing human feedback to those high-risk areas with SHF-CAS, practitioners can more efficiently correct biased or noisy reward models and improve overall LLM alignment performance.

These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies.

While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error.

While detection models show strong performance, they have the capacity to cause significant negative impacts. We explore potential biases in English machine-generated text detection systems.

We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts.

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "They propose SCOPE, a hierarchical planner that uses LLM-generated subgoals only once at initialization to pretrain a small student model for text-based planning, improving efficiency and performance over prior LLM-dependent methods.", "motivation": "Long-horizon planning in text-based environments is difficult because the action space is huge, observations are ambiguous, and rewards are sparse. While LLMs contain rich semantic knowledge helpful for planning, existing LLM-based agents require frequent LLM calls during both training and inference, which is expensive and slow. Moreover, these approaches typically keep the LLM frozen, preventing task-specific adaptation. The paper aims to build an agent that still benefits from LLM knowledge but is far more efficient and adaptable, reducing reliance on online LLM queries.", "method": "They introduce SCOPE, a one-shot hierarchical planner for text-based environments. First, they use an LLM offline to generate subgoals from example trajectories in the environment. These LLM-derived subgoals are then used to pretrain a smaller student model that learns to decompose high-level tasks into subgoals and control low-level actions, without needing further LLM access. Unlike prior work that repeatedly queries an LLM during training to adaptively generate subgoals, SCOPE only uses the LLM once at initialization, distilling its planning knowledge into the student. This sacrifices some explainability and optimality of subgoals but greatly improves computational efficiency.", "result": "On the TextCraft benchmark, SCOPE outperforms ADaPT, a strong LLM-based hierarchical agent. SCOPE achieves a 0.56 success rate versus ADaPT\u2019s 0.52, while cutting inference time dramatically from 164.4 seconds to 3.0 seconds. This demonstrates that a lightweight student model pretrained with one-shot LLM-generated subgoals can both plan effectively and run much faster than methods that rely on frequent LLM queries.", "conclusion": "One-shot subgoal-conditioned pretraining using LLM-generated subgoals is an effective way to build efficient hierarchical planners for text-based environments. Even though the subgoals are potentially suboptimal and the approach sacrifices some explainability, the distilled student model achieves better task success and is far more computationally efficient than LLM-in-the-loop methods. This suggests that offline distillation of LLM planning knowledge into smaller, trainable models is a promising direction for scalable long-term planning in complex textual domains."}}

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "They propose CONCUR, a modular, continual routing framework that chooses the best computation strategy (model + decoding etc.) per task, outperforming fixed strategies and prior routers in accuracy and cost, while making it easy to add new strategies.", "motivation": "AI tasks vary widely in difficulty and nature, so no single model/decoding strategy is best for all tasks or budgets.

Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper gives a categorical (functor-based) account of how to move between Bayesian networks and Markov networks via moralisation and triangulation, clarifying what in these transformations is purely syntactic versus semantic.", "motivation": "Existing treatments of probabilistic graphical models describe moralisation and triangulation algorithmically, but lack a high-level, structural explanation of these transformations and their relationship.

They then define moralisation and triangulation as functors between the categories of such network-functors. Moralisation is specified purely as pre-composition with a syntactic transformation. For triangulation they show that a purely syntactic account is impossible, so they factor it through a semantic step involving variable elimination, itself recast as a functor, plus a syntactic step.", "result": "The paper constructs explicit categorical categories for Bayesian and Markov networks, defines moralisation as a fully syntactic functor between them, and shows that triangulation necessarily depends on semantics. They characterise variable elimination as a functor that, combined with a syntactic transformation, realises triangulation. This yields an inductive definition of moralisation and triangulation on the syntactic side via functor pre-composition, together with a clear split of triangulation into syntactic and semantic components.", "conclusion": "Viewing probabilistic graphical models categorically, with networks as functors and transformations like moralisation and triangulation as higher-level functors between network categories, clarifies the distinction between syntactic graph operations and semantic probabilistic operations. Moralisation is inherently syntactic, whereas triangulation intrinsically involves semantics and can be decomposed using a functorial view of variable elimination. The work introduces a functorial, compositional perspective that can guide further theoretical development and modular algorithm design for graphical models."}}

Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $\u03ba$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators.

In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2.

Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices.

Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task.

This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories.
