Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline.

Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies how to efficiently navigate and reason over taxonomic \u201cexpansion graphs\u201d that generalize entity set expansion, without fully materializing these often huge graphs.", "motivation": "Traditional Entity Set Expansion methods grow sets of similar entities linearly, which fails to expose the richer taxonomic structure of concepts and their semantic generalizations present in knowledge bases.

They then analyze the computational complexity of these reasoning problems and identify conditions\u2014such as restricting input size or limiting the complexity of entity descriptions\u2014under which these tasks are tractable. The approach focuses on local reasoning that simulates navigation of the graph without constructing it in full.", "result": "The paper shows that the defined reasoning tasks over expansion graphs can be solved efficiently when realistic constraints are imposed, such as bounding the input or restricting entity descriptions.

Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores.

We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper argues that current evaluation of dialogue topic segmentation is flawed and proposes a new evaluation objective emphasizing boundary density, segment coherence, and window-tolerant F1, showing that many reported gains are artifacts of annotation granularity and sparse labels rather than true model improvements.", "motivation": "Dialogue systems increasingly rely on topic segmentation to manage long conversation histories beyond fixed context windows, but evaluation metrics are still based on strict boundary matching and exact-match F1.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own.

ELN effectively captures noise-induced uncertainty, guiding the LLM to trust or discount particular hypotheses at sentence and word levels. The findings highlight that off-the-shelf LLMs are inadequate for low-resource ASR correction without task-specific fine-tuning and explicit noise modeling, and the proposed framework offers a promising direction for robust ASR in other low-resource and noisy language settings as well."}}

Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent.

The experimental manipulations successfully and selectively move the model along these dimensions, and steering these internal states causally alters agent behavior and intergroup relations. The simulations reveal that realistic threat directly increases hostility and conflict. In contrast, the effect of symbolic threat is weaker and fully mediated by increases in ingroup bias: symbolic threat heightens ingroup preference, which only translates into greater hostility when there is no realistic threat present. When realistic threat is present, it dominates the conflict dynamics. Non-hostile intergroup contact in the simulations mitigates escalation, and when structural asymmetries between groups are introduced, hostility becomes concentrated among majority-group agents rather than being evenly distributed.", "conclusion": "The study demonstrates that LLM-based virtual societies can serve as a controlled experimental environment to derive a causal, temporally resolved account of how different types of threat shape intergroup conflict. Realistic (material) threat emerges as the primary direct driver of hostility, whereas symbolic (value) threat mainly works indirectly via ingroup bias and is consequential chiefly in the absence of realistic threat. Promoting positive intergroup contact can dampen conflict escalation, and societal asymmetries channel hostility disproportionately into majority groups. More broadly, the work suggests that probing and steering internal representations of LLM agents can reveal and manipulate socio-psychological constructs, offering a powerful complementary method to human studies under real-world constraints."}}

This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level.

The dataset captures culturally grounded cues such as rituals, attire, gestures, and interpersonal dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks. Our dataset is built through a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline, where human experts first curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM then assist in generating structured ToM-focused scene descriptions, which are refined into question-answer pairs spanning a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four graded complexity levels.

A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision.

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging.

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories.

We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search.

To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper empirically tests how humanlike AI design affects anthropomorphism, engagement, and trust across cultures, finding that effects are not universal and depend strongly on cultural context.", "motivation": "Existing debates and safety frameworks assume that making AI systems more humanlike inherently increases user trust, emotional dependence, and risk.

However, these humanlike designs do not reliably increase behavioral engagement or trust across the whole sample.

Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models.

By preserving platform-level artifacts and enabling analyses of satisfaction, citation practices, and temporal trends, it provides a timely resource for researchers and practitioners who want to better understand real-world LLM usage and the impact of interface design on behavior."}}
