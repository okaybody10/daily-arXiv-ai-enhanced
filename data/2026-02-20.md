### [1] [References Improve LLM Alignment in Non-Verifiable Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16802)
*Kejian Shi,Yixin Liu,Peifeng Wang,Alexander R. Fabbri,Shafiq Joty,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how to extend RL with verifiable rewards to non-verifiable alignment tasks by turning LLM evaluators into soft, reference-guided verifiers, and shows this significantly boosts alignment training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL with verifiable rewards works well when there is a ground-truth checker, but many key domains for LLMs (like alignment and open-ended generation) lack strict verifiers, making it hard to apply RLVR-style methods. The authors want to know if we can approximate verifiable rewards using LLM-based evaluators that are guided by high-quality reference outputs, so that we can still get reliable reward signals for alignment and post-training.

Method: 1) Design evaluation protocols where an LLM judge scores candidate answers by comparing them to one or more reference outputs. 2) Use references from stronger models or humans to guide weaker LLM judges, and also test improvements for already-strong judges with human references. 3) Plug these improved, reference-guided judges into a self-improvement loop: the target LLM generates outputs, the judge scores them using references, and those scores guide alignment tuning. 4) Compare this reference-guided self-improvement against standard supervised fine-tuning on references, and against self-improvement using reference-free LLM judges, as well as a strong reward model baseline (ArmoRM).

Result: Reference-guided evaluation greatly boosts the accuracy of weaker LLM judges when they use references from frontier models, and even strong judges benefit from high-quality human references. When these enhanced judges are used for self-improvement, models trained with reference-guided signals outperform both (a) pure SFT distillation from the references and (b) self-improvement with judges that do not see references. On AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, the method yields large performance gains (around +20 points vs SFT and +4–5 points vs reference-free self-improvement) and reaches performance comparable to training with the strong ArmoRM reward model, across Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B.

Conclusion: LLM evaluators can act as effective soft verifiers when provided with high-quality reference outputs, closing part of the gap between verifiable and non-verifiable domains. Reference-guided judges not only evaluate more accurately but also enable more effective alignment tuning via self-improvement than standard SFT or reference-free judges, achieving results comparable to a strong specialized reward model. This suggests that reference-guided evaluators are a promising, practical tool for post-training LLMs in non-verifiable alignment settings.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown strong effectiveness in reasoning tasks, it cannot be directly applied to non-verifiable domains lacking ground-truth verifiers, such as LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft "verifiers". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains.

### [2] [Evaluating Monolingual and Multilingual Large Language Models for Greek Question Answering: The DemosQA Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16811)
*Charalampos Mastrokostas,Nikolaos Giarelis,Nikos Karacapilidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Greek QA dataset (DemosQA), a light-weight evaluation framework, and a broad comparison of mono- vs multilingual LLMs on multiple Greek QA datasets with different prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM research and datasets focus on high-resource languages like English. Multilingual LLMs are biased toward a few dominant languages and often use transfer learning, which can misrepresent social, cultural, and historical aspects of under-resourced languages. For Greek, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of monolingual versus multilingual LLMs on realistic, culturally grounded QA tasks.

Method: The authors (1) build DemosQA from real social media questions and community-reviewed answers to reflect contemporary Greek social and cultural content; (2) design a memory-efficient, adaptable LLM evaluation framework for QA tasks in various languages and datasets; and (3) conduct a large-scale empirical study where 11 mono- and multilingual LLMs are evaluated on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets under 3 prompting strategies.

Result: They obtain comparative performance results across 11 LLMs, showing how monolingual and multilingual models behave on Greek QA and under different prompting setups. The results quantify the strengths and weaknesses of each model type and demonstrate that the proposed framework can efficiently handle diverse QA datasets.

Conclusion: Monolingual LLMs for under-resourced languages like Greek can be rigorously benchmarked and compared to multilingual models using a memory-efficient framework. The new DemosQA dataset captures culturally relevant Greek QA content, and the released code and data provide a foundation for more culturally aligned and reproducible research on Greek and other under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning have enabled the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art across a wide range of tasks, including Question Answering (QA). Despite these advancements, research on LLMs has primarily targeted high-resourced languages (e.g., English), and only recently has attention shifted toward multilingual models. However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility.

### [3] [One-step Language Modeling via Continuous Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16813)
*Chanhyuk Lee,Jaehoon Yoo,Manan Agarwal,Sheel Shah,Jerry Huang,Aditi Raghunathan,Seunghoon Hong,Nicholas M. Boffi,Jinwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces flow-based language models (FLM/FMLM) that perform continuous denoising over one-hot token encodings, achieving higher quality and faster few-step generation than discrete diffusion language models, thus challenging the necessity of discrete diffusion for discrete sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion language models are popular because they promise faster, parallel generation than autoregressive models, but in practice they suffer from strong quality degradation when using only a few denoising steps, which undermines their key advantage. The motivation is to find a generative modeling approach for discrete sequences that maintains high sample quality while enabling genuinely fast, few-step generation, and to test whether diffusion over discrete states is actually necessary for good performance on language modeling.

Method: The authors revisit flow-based modeling for discrete data by embedding tokens as one-hot vectors in Euclidean space and learning a continuous-time flow that denoises these encodings. They construct a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising and is trained via a cross-entropy objective to predict the clean data, combined with a simple but important time reparameterization to stabilize training and improve quality. They then distill the learned flow into its explicit flow map, yielding a Flow Map Language Model (FMLM) that supports few-step, parallel generation. The approach is evaluated on the LM1B and OpenWebText language modeling benchmarks against discrete diffusion and other few-step methods.

Result: On LM1B and OWT, FLM matches the generation quality of state-of-the-art discrete diffusion language models, showing that continuous flow-based denoising over one-hot encodings is competitive with discrete diffusion in the multi-step regime. The distilled FMLM achieves superior performance in the few-step setting: across all tested metrics it outperforms recent few-step language models, and its one-step generation quality surpasses the 8-step quality of competing methods, while being faster due to fewer denoising steps.

Conclusion: Flow-based continuous denoising over one-hot token encodings is a powerful alternative to discrete diffusion for language modeling, enabling high-quality and faster few-step generation. The success of FLM and FMLM challenges the assumption that discrete diffusion processes are required for effective generative modeling over discrete modalities and indicates that flow-based approaches may be a more scalable and efficient direction for accelerated language model generation.

Abstract: Language models based on discrete diffusion have attracted widespread interest for their potential to provide faster generation than autoregressive models. In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

### [4] [Claim Automation using Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16836)
*Zhengda Mo,Zhiyu Quan,Eli O'Donohue,Kaiwen Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper fine-tunes locally deployed LLMs with LoRA on millions of historical warranty claims to generate structured corrective-action recommendations from unstructured insurance claim narratives, showing domain-specific models greatly outperform general-purpose and prompt-based LLMs and achieve about 80% near-identical matches to ground truth, supporting domain-adaptive fine-tuning as a governable building block for insurance applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs work well on general tasks but are rarely deployed in highly regulated, data-sensitive domains like insurance due to governance, accuracy, and privacy concerns. Claims processing requires translating messy, unstructured narratives into precise, auditable corrective actions, and existing general-purpose or API-based models are not sufficiently accurate, controllable, or compliant. The authors are motivated to create a governance-aware, locally deployable language model that can reliably support claim adjusters while fitting into existing operational and regulatory constraints.

Method: Using millions of historical warranty claim records, the authors fine-tune pretrained LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to specialize them on the task of generating structured corrective-action recommendations from free-text claim descriptions. The scope is restricted to a specific initial decision module in the claim processing pipeline to make the problem tractable and directly useful. They evaluate the system through a multi-dimensional framework combining automated semantic similarity metrics and human expert evaluation, to measure both predictive accuracy and practical utility. They then compare the fine-tuned domain model against commercial general-purpose LLMs and prompt-based approaches.

Result: The domain-fine-tuned LLM significantly outperforms both commercial general-purpose models and prompt-only baselines on the corrective-action recommendation task. About 80% of evaluated cases yield outputs that are near-identical to the ground-truth corrective actions extracted from historical data. The evaluation shows improvements not just in semantic similarity scores but also in human-judged usefulness and alignment with operational requirements.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive fine-tuning of LLMs using historical operational data can substantially align model outputs with real-world decision patterns in insurance claims processing. A locally deployed, governance-aware LLM component can reliably support an early decision module in the claim workflow, improving speed and consistency while satisfying regulatory and privacy constraints. The study positions such fine-tuned models as promising, governable building blocks for broader deployment of LLMs in insurance and other regulated, data-sensitive domains.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on general-purpose language tasks, their deployment in regulated and data-sensitive domains, including insurance, remains limited. Leveraging millions of historical warranty claims, we propose a locally deployed governance-aware language modeling component that generates structured corrective-action recommendations from unstructured claim narratives. We fine-tune pretrained LLMs using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), scoping the model to an initial decision module within the claim processing pipeline to speed up claim adjusters' decisions. We assess this module using a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that combines automated semantic similarity metrics with human evaluation, enabling a rigorous examination of both practical utility and predictive accuracy. Our results show that domain-specific fine-tuning substantially outperforms commercial general-purpose and prompt-based LLMs, with approximately 80% of the evaluated cases achieving near-identical matches to ground-truth corrective actions. Overall, this study provides both theoretical and empirical evidence to prove that domain-adaptive fine-tuning can align model output distributions more closely with real-world operational data, demonstrating its promise as a reliable and governable building block for insurance applications.

### [5] [BanglaSummEval: Reference-Free Factual Consistency Evaluation for Bangla Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16843)
*Ahmed Rafid,Rumman Adib,Fariya Ahmed,Ajwad Abrar,Mohammed Saidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents BanglaSummEval, a reference-free, QA-based metric for evaluating the factual consistency of Bangla summaries, using a single multilingual LLM to generate and answer questions and BERTScore-Recall to compare answers, achieving high correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Factual consistency in summarization is critical, especially for domains like healthcare and news, but Bangla is under-served by existing metrics, which are mostly designed for high-resource languages and rely on reference summaries. The authors aim to fill this gap with a robust, practical evaluation method tailored for Bangla and other low-resource settings.

Method: They design BanglaSummEval, a reference-free evaluation framework that automatically generates questions from the source and summary, answers them, extracts candidate answers, and assigns importance weights using a single multilingual instruction-tuned LLM, then uses BERTScore-Recall to measure semantic similarity between source-based and summary-based answers to estimate factual accuracy and content coverage.

Result: On a dataset of 300 human-written Bangla summaries from educational and medical domains, the metric’s scores correlate strongly with expert human judgments of factual consistency, with Pearson correlation r = 0.694 and Spearman correlation ρ = 0.763.

Conclusion: BanglaSummEval provides an effective, interpretable, and computationally efficient solution for measuring factual consistency in Bangla summarization without needing reference summaries, making it a practical tool for low-resource language evaluation and offering step-wise diagnostic insights beyond a single score.

Abstract: Evaluating factual consistency is essential for reliable text summarization, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and news. However, most existing evaluation metrics overlook Bangla, a widely spoken yet under-resourced language, and often depend on reference summaries. We introduce BanglaSummEval, a reference-free, question-answering-based framework for evaluating factual consistency in Bangla summarization. The proposed method assesses both factual accuracy and content coverage through automatically generated questions and answers derived from the source document and the summary. A single multilingual instruction-tuned language model handles question generation, question answering, candidate answer extraction, and question importance weighting. This unified design reduces system complexity and computational cost. To capture semantic consistency beyond surface-level overlap, we use BERTScore-Recall for answer comparison. We validate BanglaSummEval on 300 human-written summaries from educational and medical domains, demonstrating strong correlation with expert human judgments (Pearson's $r = 0.694$, Spearman's $ρ= 0.763$). By providing interpretable, step-wise diagnostics alongside reliable evaluation scores, BanglaSummEval offers a practical and transparent solution for factual consistency evaluation in low-resource language settings.

### [6] [Meenz bleibt Meenz, but Large Language Models Do Not Speak Its Dialect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16852)
*Minh Duc Bui,Manuel Mager,Peter Herbert Kann,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first NLP-ready digital dictionary for the Meenzerisch dialect (2,351 entries) and evaluates how well current large language models can define dialect words and generate dialect words from German definitions, finding very low accuracies (<10%) even with few-shot and rule-based prompts, underscoring the need for more resources and research on German dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meenzerisch, the dialect of Mainz and traditional language of its famous carnival, is rapidly disappearing like many German dialects. While NLP could support preservation and revitalization, no prior NLP work targets Meenzerisch specifically. The authors aim to fill this gap by creating resources and providing an empirical baseline of what current LLMs can (and cannot) do with this low-resource dialect, thereby motivating further research and resource creation for German dialects.

Method: 1) Construct an NLP-ready digital dictionary by digitizing and structuring an existing lexicographic resource (Schramm, 1966), yielding 2,351 Meenzerisch word entries paired with Standard German definitions. 2) Formulate two main tasks: (a) definition generation in Standard German given a Meenzerisch word; (b) Meenzerisch word generation given a Standard German definition. 3) Evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on both tasks, using accuracy as the primary metric. 4) Conduct two enhancement experiments: (i) few-shot prompting with examples; (ii) prompting with explicit rules extracted from the training set, to see whether structured hints improve performance.

Result: Baseline experiments show that SOTA LLMs perform very poorly on both tasks: the best model for generating Standard German definitions of dialect words reaches only 6.27% accuracy, while the best model for generating dialect words from their German definitions achieves 1.51% accuracy. Few-shot learning and rule-based prompting improve scores somewhat but still keep accuracy below 10% on both tasks, confirming that current models have almost no competence in Meenzerisch given existing data and training regimes.

Conclusion: The study provides the first structured NLP resource for Meenzerisch and systematic evaluation of LLMs on this dialect, demonstrating that current models are effectively incapable of handling Meenzerisch for either definition generation or word generation. Even enhanced prompting strategies yield accuracies below 10%, which signals that Meenzerisch and similar German dialects are severely under-resourced in modern NLP. The authors conclude that substantially more data, tailored methods, and focused research are urgently required to support the preservation, modeling, and revitalization of German dialects like Meenzerisch.

Abstract: Meenzerisch, the dialect spoken in the German city of Mainz, is also the traditional language of the Mainz carnival, a yearly celebration well known throughout Germany. However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed.

### [7] [A Conceptual Hybrid Framework for Post-Quantum Security: Integrating BB84 QKD, AES, and Bio-inspired Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16922)
*Md. Ismiel Hossen Abir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes RSA’s vulnerability to quantum attacks and proposes a conceptual hybrid classical–quantum security framework for post-quantum data protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RSA and other classical cryptosystems are threatened by quantum algorithms like Shor’s, which can factor large integers efficiently, rendering current public-key infrastructure insecure in a future with scalable quantum computers. The work is motivated by the need to understand RSA’s weaknesses under both classical and quantum attacks and to sketch a more resilient, forward-looking security architecture for the post-quantum era.

Method: The paper conceptually studies RSA’s security against classical factorization algorithms (Trial Division, Pollard’s Rho) versus Shor’s quantum algorithm, emphasizing the polynomial-time quantum threat. It then designs a high-level hybrid framework that integrates: (1) AES as a classical symmetric cipher for bulk data encryption; (2) BB84 QKD to establish shared keys with built-in eavesdropping detection; (3) quantum state comparison as a lightweight authentication mechanism; and (4) an artificial immune-system–inspired module to adaptively detect and respond to threats. The approach is architectural and theoretical rather than implementing or formally proving the scheme.

Result: The study confirms that RSA is practically secure against known classical factorization methods for large key sizes but becomes vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. It reports that BB84 can achieve full key agreement under idealized conditions and can detect eavesdropping with high accuracy. The main tangible outcome is a proposed conceptual model that integrates classical cryptography, QKD, quantum-based authentication, and adaptive bio-inspired defense into a cohesive, scalable post-quantum security framework.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that RSA cannot be relied upon in a mature quantum computing era and that hybrid architectures combining classical and quantum security primitives are necessary for robust post-quantum protection. The proposed framework illustrates how AES, BB84 QKD, quantum state comparison, and immune-system–inspired threat detection can be orchestrated to improve resilience. However, the work remains conceptual; rigorous implementation details, formal security proofs, performance analysis, and large-scale experimental validation are deferred to future research.

Abstract: Quantum computing is a significant risk to classical cryptographic, especially RSA, which depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Classical factorization methods, such as Trial Division and Pollard's Rho, are inefficient for large keys, while Shor's quantum algorithm can break RSA efficiently in polynomial time. This research studies RSA's vulnerabilities under both classical and quantum attacks and designs a hybrid security framework to ensure data protection in the post-quantum era. The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection. This work primarily proposes a conceptual framework. Detailed implementation, security proofs, and extensive experimental validation are considered future work.

### [8] [ConvApparel: A Benchmark Dataset and Validation Framework for User Simulators in Conversational Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16938)
*Ofer Meshi,Krisztian Balog,Sally Goldman,Avi Caciularu,Guy Tennenholtz,Jihwan Jeong,Amir Globerson,Craig Boutilier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents ConvApparel, a human-AI conversation dataset and validation framework to measure and reduce the realism gap in LLM-based user simulators for conversational recommenders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based user simulators are widely used to train and evaluate conversational AI systems, but they often differ substantially from real users, causing systems optimized in simulation to fail when deployed. The authors aim to rigorously measure this “realism gap” and provide data and tools to build more realistic simulators, especially for conversational recommendation scenarios.

Method: They create ConvApparel, a dataset collected via a dual-agent setup where users interact with both a high-quality (“good”) and a low-quality (“bad”) recommender. This setup yields diverse user experiences and first-person satisfaction annotations that enable counterfactual comparisons. On top of this, they propose a validation framework with three pillars: (1) statistical alignment between simulated and real interaction statistics, (2) a human-likeness score assessing how similar simulator outputs are to real user behavior, and (3) counterfactual validation, where simulators must respond appropriately to changes in recommender quality and user behavior that they did not see during training.

Result: Applying the framework to various user simulators, they find a clear realism gap for all models: simulators do not fully match real user behavior, especially in how they react to different recommender qualities and experiences. Nonetheless, simulators trained in a data-driven manner (e.g., fine-tuned on interaction data) consistently outperform a purely prompted LLM baseline across the validation metrics, with particularly strong gains on counterfactual validation tests.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that current LLM-based user simulators are still imperfect proxies for real users but that realism can be improved with data-driven approaches. ConvApparel and the proposed validation framework provide a principled way to quantify and compare this realism, highlighting that better-trained simulators adapt more plausibly to unseen behaviors and system changes, thereby offering a more reliable foundation for developing and testing conversational AI systems.

Abstract: The promise of LLM-based user simulators to improve conversational AI is hindered by a critical "realism gap," leading to systems that are optimized for simulated interactions, but may fail to perform well in the real world. We introduce ConvApparel, a new dataset of human-AI conversations designed to address this gap. Its unique dual-agent data collection protocol -- using both "good" and "bad" recommenders -- enables counterfactual validation by capturing a wide spectrum of user experiences, enriched with first-person annotations of user satisfaction. We propose a comprehensive validation framework that combines statistical alignment, a human-likeness score, and counterfactual validation to test for generalization. Our experiments reveal a significant realism gap across all simulators. However, the framework also shows that data-driven simulators outperform a prompted baseline, particularly in counterfactual validation where they adapt more realistically to unseen behaviors, suggesting they embody more robust, if imperfect, user models.

### [9] [When Semantic Overlap Is Not Enough: Cross-Lingual Euphemism Transfer Between Turkish and English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16957)
*Hasan Can Biyik,Libby Barak,Jing Peng,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how well euphemism detection transfers between Turkish and English, showing that even when euphemisms overlap semantically, cross-lingual transfer can be weak or negative, especially from low-resource Turkish to English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euphemisms are culturally and pragmatically dependent, making them challenging for multilingual NLP models. The authors want to understand when and how detection models trained in one language can transfer to another, and how cross-lingual semantic equivalence affects this transfer.

Method: They define Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) in Turkish and English and split them into Overlapping PETs (OPETs), where euphemisms are functionally/pragmatically/semantically aligned across languages, and Non-Overlapping PETs (NOPETs). They train multilingual euphemism detection models under different training regimes (OPET-based vs NOPET-based) and directions (Turkish→English and English→Turkish), then analyze performance, label distributions, and category-level/domain alignment.

Result: They observe asymmetric transfer: semantic overlap does not reliably give positive transfer. Transfer from low-resource Turkish to English can perform poorly even on overlapping euphemisms, while NOPET-based training can sometimes yield better transfer. They find that differences in label distribution across languages partly explain the negative or counterintuitive transfer effects. Category-level and domain-specific factors appear to matter, but evidence is limited by data sparsity.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual equivalence at the level of semantic overlap is not enough to ensure successful transfer in multilingual euphemism detection. Transfer behavior is asymmetric and sensitive to data resources, label distributions, and potentially domain-specific alignment. More nuanced modeling and better-balanced resources are needed for robust euphemism detection across languages.

Abstract: Euphemisms substitute socially sensitive expressions, often softening or reframing meaning, and their reliance on cultural and pragmatic context complicates modeling across languages. In this study, we investigate how cross-lingual equivalence influences transfer in multilingual euphemism detection. We categorize Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) in Turkish and English into Overlapping (OPETs) and Non-Overlapping (NOPETs) subsets based on their functional, pragmatic, and semantic alignment. Our findings reveal a transfer asymmetry: semantic overlap is insufficient to guarantee positive transfer, particularly in low-resource Turkish-to-English direction, where performance can degrade even for overlapping euphemisms, and in some cases, improve under NOPET-based training. Differences in label distribution help explain these counterintuitive results. Category-level analysis suggests that transfer may be influenced by domain-specific alignment, though evidence is limited by sparsity.

### [10] [Eigenmood Space: Uncertainty-Aware Spectral Graph Analysis of Psychological Patterns in Classical Persian Poetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16959)
*Kourosh Shahnazari,Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh,Mohammadali Keshtparvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build an uncertainty-aware computational framework to analyze psychological concepts in classical Persian poetry at the poet level using large-scale automatic annotation, graph methods, and spectral embeddings, while explicitly modeling abstention and confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Persian poetry encodes psychological and affective life via dense metaphor and rhetorical indirection, so traditional close reading is essential but does not scale. There is a need for reproducible, large-scale, and quantitative analysis of poets’ psychological profiles that still respects ambiguity and uncertainty instead of forcing brittle point estimates from noisy automatic labels.

Method: They automatically assign multiple psychological concept labels to each verse, along with per-label confidence scores and an abstention flag when evidence is insufficient. They then aggregate these confidence-weighted labels into a Poet × Concept matrix and interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts. They quantify each poet’s individuality as divergence from the overall corpus distribution using Jensen–Shannon and Kullback–Leibler divergences. To capture relational structure among concepts, they build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph of concepts and obtain an “Eigenmood” embedding via Laplacian spectral decomposition. They also perform sensitivity analysis under different confidence thresholds, treat abstention as its own category to diagnose selection bias, and design a workflow that moves from corpus-level patterns to verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes.

Result: On a dataset of 61,573 verses from 10 poets, about 22.2% of verses are abstained from labeling, demonstrating that uncertainty is pervasive and must be modeled explicitly. The framework yields poet-level distributions over psychological concepts, divergence-based measures of poetic individuality, a low-dimensional Eigenmood space capturing co-occurrence structure among concepts, and a practical procedure for retrieving representative verses corresponding to positions in this space. The analyses show that it is feasible to conduct scalable, quantitative psychological profiling of poets while surfacing and propagating annotation uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables large-scale, auditable digital humanities research on affect and psychology in classical Persian poetry by combining probabilistic multi-label annotation, information-theoretic measures, and spectral graph methods. Crucially, it preserves interpretive caution by representing and propagating uncertainty—from verse-level annotation (including abstention) up through poet-level inference and exploratory visualizations—rather than hiding it behind point estimates.

Abstract: Classical Persian poetry is a historically sustained archive in which affective life is expressed through metaphor, intertextual convention, and rhetorical indirection. These properties make close reading indispensable while limiting reproducible comparison at scale. We present an uncertainty-aware computational framework for poet-level psychological analysis based on large-scale automatic multi-label annotation. Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence. To capture relational structure beyond marginals, we build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph over concepts and define an Eigenmood embedding through Laplacian spectral decomposition. On a corpus of 61{,}573 verses across 10 poets, 22.2\% of verses are abstained, underscoring the analytical importance of uncertainty. We further report sensitivity analysis under confidence thresholding, selection-bias diagnostics that treat abstention as a category, and a distant-to-close workflow that retrieves verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes. The resulting framework supports scalable, auditable digital-humanities analysis while preserving interpretive caution by propagating uncertainty from verse-level evidence to poet-level inference.

### [11] [Persona2Web: Benchmarking Personalized Web Agents for Contextual Reasoning with User History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17003)
*Serin Kim,Sangam Lee,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona2Web introduces a benchmark to evaluate how well web agents can personalize their behavior by inferring user preferences from long-term history rather than explicit instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web agents powered by large language models struggle with personalization because users typically give short, ambiguous queries and do not explicitly state all their preferences or context. There is a lack of standardized ways to test whether agents can leverage long-term user histories to resolve this ambiguity on the real, open web. The authors aim to fill this gap with a principled, realistic benchmark focused on personalization via inference from history.

Method: The authors build Persona2Web, a benchmark based on the "clarify-to-personalize" principle, where agents must resolve ambiguous queries by inferring preferences from user history. The benchmark comprises three main components: (1) long-term user histories that indirectly encode preferences over time, (2) carefully designed ambiguous queries whose correct resolution depends on those implicit preferences, and (3) a reasoning-aware evaluation framework that assesses not only task success but also the quality of personalization reasoning. They then run extensive experiments across different web-agent architectures, LLM backbones, strategies for accessing and using user history, and queries with different ambiguity levels.

Result: Experiments across diverse setups show that current web agents face substantial difficulties in correctly using user history to personalize behavior on ambiguous tasks. Performance varies with architecture, backbone model, and how history is accessed, and degrades notably as query ambiguity increases. These results expose systematic gaps in current personalized web agent capabilities and highlight which design choices matter most for personalization.

Conclusion: Persona2Web is proposed as the first benchmark focused on evaluating personalized web agents on the open web, grounded in inferring preferences from user history rather than explicit instructions. The study demonstrates that state-of-the-art agents still struggle with such personalization, especially under higher ambiguity, underscoring the need for improved methods and providing a public benchmark, code, and data to drive future research.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced web agents, yet current agents lack personalization capabilities. Since users rarely specify every detail of their intent, practical web agents must be able to interpret ambiguous queries by inferring user preferences and contexts. To address this challenge, we present Persona2Web, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized web agents on the real open web, built upon the clarify-to-personalize principle, which requires agents to resolve ambiguity based on user history rather than relying on explicit instructions. Persona2Web consists of: (1) user histories that reveal preferences implicitly over long time spans, (2) ambiguous queries that require agents to infer implicit user preferences, and (3) a reasoning-aware evaluation framework that enables fine-grained assessment of personalization. We conduct extensive experiments across various agent architectures, backbone models, history access schemes, and queries with varying ambiguity levels, revealing key challenges in personalized web agent behavior. For reproducibility, our codes and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Persona2Web-73E8.

### [12] [ReIn: Conversational Error Recovery with Reasoning Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17022)
*Takyoung Kim,Jinseok Nam,Chandrayee Basu,Xing Fan,Chengyuan Ma,Heng Ji,Gokhan Tur,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time method that injects externally generated recovery reasoning into LLM-based conversational agents to help them recover from dialogue errors without changing model weights or prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based conversational agents with tools work well on standard task-oriented benchmarks but often fail when users behave unpredictably—e.g., giving ambiguous or unsupported requests. Existing approaches typically aim to prevent errors or rely on costly model fine-tuning or prompt engineering. There is a need for a lightweight way to detect and recover from dialogue errors in real time, under realistic constraints where one cannot continuously modify or retrain the backbone models or system prompts.

Method: The authors propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention framework. First, an external inception module monitors the dialogue context and detects predefined error types (e.g., ambiguity, unsupported requests). Then, this module generates a recovery plan describing how the agent should correct course. Instead of editing the system prompt or model parameters, this recovery plan is injected into the agent’s internal reasoning process (its chain-of-thought/tool-use planning) so that subsequent decisions are influenced by the recovery guidance. The method is evaluated by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios and pairing different backbone LLM agents with different inception modules.

Result: Across various combinations of conversational agents and inception modules, ReIn significantly increases task success rates on simulated failure scenarios involving ambiguous or unsupported user requests. The approach generalizes to some unseen error types and consistently outperforms baselines that rely on explicit prompt modification for recovery. This shows that external reasoning injection at test time can adapt agent behavior effectively without retraining or re-prompting the base model.

Conclusion: ReIn is an effective, efficient, and non-invasive way to make LLM-based conversational agents more resilient to user-induced errors. By externally detecting dialogue problems and injecting recovery reasoning into the model’s internal decision-making, agents can recover from flawed contexts without altering backbone parameters or system prompts. The analysis further suggests that combining ReIn with carefully designed recovery tools, while respecting instruction hierarchies, offers a safe and scalable strategy to improve robustness of conversational systems in realistic, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with tool integration achieve strong performance on fixed task-oriented dialogue datasets but remain vulnerable to unanticipated, user-induced errors. Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts.

### [13] [Large Language Models Persuade Without Planning Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17045)
*Jared Moore,Rasmus Overmark,Ned Cooper,Beba Cibralic,Nick Haber,Cameron R. Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interactive persuasion task to test theory of mind in humans and LLMs, finding that LLMs struggle when they must infer hidden mental states but are highly effective persuaders overall, often surpassing humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM benchmarks for humans and LLMs are mostly static Q&A tasks, whereas philosophical and cognitive theories emphasize that genuine ToM involves first-person interaction and using others' mental states in dynamic contexts. The authors want a more ecologically valid, interactive test that can distinguish between true ToM-based reasoning and surface-level pattern use or rhetoric, especially in light of concerns about LLMs influencing human beliefs.

Method: The authors design a persuasion game where a persuader must get a target to choose one of three policy proposals by selectively revealing information. The persuader’s success hinges on tracking the target’s knowledge about the policies and their motivational preferences. They manipulate whether the target’s knowledge and values are overtly Revealed or kept Hidden, forcing persuaders to ask about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants (humans and LLMs) persuade a rational bot that follows strict inference rules. In Experiment 2, humans role-play the bot as targets. In Experiment 3, real human targets’ genuine beliefs are measured to see if persuasion actually changes them. LLM and human performance are compared across all conditions.

Result: In the rational-bot setting (Experiment 1), LLMs perform very well when target knowledge and preferences are Revealed, but they do worse than chance when those states are Hidden, implying difficulties with multi-step planning to elicit and leverage mental state information. Humans, in contrast, perform reasonably well in both conditions, suggesting they do plan around others’ hidden beliefs and desires. In Experiments 2 and 3, when human targets are involved and real belief change is measured, LLM persuaders outperform human persuaders in all conditions, regardless of whether mental states are Revealed or Hidden.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that strong persuasive performance does not require explicit or human-like theory of mind reasoning; LLMs may rely instead on powerful rhetorical strategies and pattern-matching. Although humans show more robust planning around hidden mental states in a structured rational task, LLMs are nonetheless more effective at changing human beliefs overall. Therefore, the authors argue that ToM-like competence should not be readily ascribed to current LLMs, while also emphasizing the societal importance and potential risks of their high persuasive power.

Abstract: A growing body of work attempts to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) abilities of humans and large language models (LLMs) using static, non-interactive question-and-answer benchmarks. However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior.

### [14] [Evaluating Cross-Lingual Classification Approaches Enabling Topic Discovery for Multilingual Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17051)
*Deepak Uniyal,Md Abul Bashar,Richi Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares four cross-lingual text classification strategies to clean noisy, multilingual Twitter data about hydrogen energy, then applies topic modeling to the filtered tweets to study global debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual social media debates, such as those on hydrogen energy, are hard to analyze because they span multiple languages and keyword-based data collection yields lots of irrelevant content. There is a need to understand which cross-lingual text classification pipeline best filters relevant posts at scale and across languages, balancing translation and multilingual modeling trade-offs.

Method: The authors collect a decade of hydrogen-related tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean via keyword search, resulting in a noisy, partially irrelevant dataset. They compare four strategies for filtering relevant tweets: (1) translate English-labeled data into other languages and train separate monolingual classifiers; (2) translate all tweets into English and train a single classifier on English labels; (3) directly apply an English fine-tuned multilingual transformer to each non-English language; and (4) a hybrid approach leveraging both translated labels and multilingual training. They evaluate each approach on its ability to identify hydrogen-related tweets, then run topic modeling on the filtered subsets to extract main themes.

Result: All four approaches can filter hydrogen-related tweets but with different trade-offs. Some methods may perform better in languages with fewer resources or suffer from translation noise, while others benefit from multilingual representation sharing. The experiments reveal which combinations of translation and multilingual models yield the most reliable filtering performance across English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean, enabling cleaner corpora for downstream topic modeling.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual text classification for multilingual social media analysis involves significant trade-offs between translation-based and multilingual modeling strategies. By systematically comparing four approaches on hydrogen-related Twitter data, the study provides practical guidance on selecting and combining methods to improve the relevance filtering and topic discovery in large-scale, multilingual public debates.

Abstract: Analysing multilingual social media discourse remains a major challenge in natural language processing, particularly when large-scale public debates span across diverse languages. This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets. The results highlight key trade-offs between translation and multilingual approaches, offering actionable insights into optimising cross-lingual pipelines for large-scale social media analysis.

### [15] [ALPS: A Diagnostic Challenge Set for Arabic Linguistic & Pragmatic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17054)
*Hussein S. Al-Olimat,Ahmad Alshareef*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALPS is an expert-curated Arabic diagnostic benchmark that tests deep semantics and pragmatics using native data, revealing that current models are fluent but weak on core morpho-syntactic dependencies, with commercial models outperforming Arabic-native ones yet still below expert-level human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arabic NLP benchmarks emphasize size and breadth, often using synthetic or translated data that can hide real linguistic challenges and cultural nuances; there is a need for a native, fine-grained, linguistically grounded benchmark to probe deep semantic and pragmatic understanding and to diagnose specific weaknesses of Arabic language models.

Method: The authors design ALPS, a suite of 531 manually and expertly crafted questions spanning 15 tasks and 47 subtasks aimed at deep semantics and pragmatics, ensuring cultural authenticity and avoiding translation artifacts; they then evaluate 23 diverse models—commercial, open-source, and Arabic-focused—against two human baselines: average single-pass human accuracy and an expert-adjudicated oracle, comparing performance across task types, particularly morpho-syntactic vs. compositional semantic tasks.

Result: Human single-pass performance on ALPS averages 84.6% accuracy, while an expert-adjudicated oracle reaches 99.2%; the best commercial model (Gemini-3-flash) attains 94.2%, surpassing average humans, whereas the best Arabic-native model (Jais-2-70B) reaches 83.6%, slightly below average human performance; across models there is a notable dissociation between surface fluency and true linguistic competence, with particularly high error rates (36.5%) on morpho-syntactic, diacritics-sensitive tasks compared to compositional semantic tasks.

Conclusion: ALPS demonstrates that despite impressive fluency, current Arabic language models systematically struggle with core morpho-syntactic and pragmatic phenomena, and that large commercial models still significantly outperform Arabic-native ones; the benchmark provides a fine-grained, culturally authentic diagnostic tool that complements large-scale benchmarks and can guide future improvements in Arabic linguistic modeling, especially around deep semantics, morpho-syntax, and diacritics-sensitive phenomena.

Abstract: While recent Arabic NLP benchmarks focus on scale, they often rely on synthetic or translated data which may benefit from deeper linguistic verification. We introduce ALPS (Arabic Linguistic & Pragmatic Suite), a native, expert-curated diagnostic challenge set probing Deep Semantics and Pragmatics, capabilities that complement specialized large-scale benchmarks. While broad-coverage benchmarks prioritize scale and multi-task coverage, ALPS targets the depth of linguistic understanding through 531 rigorously crafted questions across 15 tasks and 47 subtasks. We developed the dataset with deep expertise in Arabic linguistics, guaranteeing cultural authenticity and eliminating translation artifacts. Evaluating 23 diverse models (commercial, open-source, and Arabic-native) against a single-pass human performance (avg. 84.6% accuracy) and an expert-adjudicated oracle (99.2%), we reveal a critical dissociation: models achieve high fluency but fail on fundamental morpho-syntactic dependencies, with elevated error rates on morpho-syntactic dependencies (36.5% across diacritics-reliant tasks) compared to compositional semantics. While top commercial models (Gemini-3-flash at 94.2%) surpass the average single human, a substantial gap persists between commercial giants and Arabic-native models, with the best Arabic-specific model (Jais-2-70B at 83.6%) approaching but not matching human performance.

### [16] [BankMathBench: A Benchmark for Numerical Reasoning in Banking Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17072)
*Yunseung Lee,Subin Kim,Youngjun Kwak,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BankMathBench, a banking-focused numerical reasoning benchmark for LLMs and shows it substantially improves LLM accuracy on realistic banking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs used in digital banking struggle with core banking computations that require multi-step numerical reasoning, yet current math and finance benchmarks do not adequately cover realistic, everyday banking scenarios. There is a need for a domain-specific benchmark capturing these tasks to evaluate and improve LLMs' performance in banking contexts.

Method: The authors construct BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset reflecting realistic banking tasks related to products like deposits, savings, and loans. The benchmark is structured into three difficulty levels: basic (single-product reasoning), intermediate (multi-product comparison), and advanced (multi-condition scenarios). They then train open-source LLMs on this dataset, including setups with tool-augmented fine-tuning, and evaluate their performance on formula generation and numerical reasoning tasks versus zero-shot baselines.

Result: Training on BankMathBench leads to marked improvements in open-source LLMs' formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy on banking tasks. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, models achieve average accuracy gains of 57.6 percentage points on basic tasks, 75.1 percentage points on intermediate tasks, and 62.9 percentage points on advanced tasks compared with zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: BankMathBench effectively captures real-world banking numerical reasoning tasks and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating and advancing LLM performance in digital banking contexts. Its use in training significantly boosts LLMs' accuracy on complex banking computations, showing that targeted, domain-specific datasets can substantially enhance LLM reasoning in practical financial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based chatbots are increasingly being adopted in the financial domain, particularly in digital banking, to handle customer inquiries about products such as deposits, savings, and loans. However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines. These findings highlight BankMathBench as a reliable benchmark for evaluating and advancing LLMs' numerical reasoning in real-world banking scenarios.

### [17] [The Emergence of Lab-Driven Alignment Signatures: A Psychometric Framework for Auditing Latent Bias and Compounding Risk in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17127)
*Dusan Bosnjakovic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a psychometrics-based auditing framework to detect stable, provider-level behavioral signatures in LLMs—such as optimization bias and sycophancy—that traditional accuracy benchmarks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become foundational reasoning components in multi-agent and recursive systems (e.g., LLM-as-a-judge), their persistent behavioral tendencies can shape entire AI ecosystems. Existing benchmarks focus on short-term task accuracy and overlook durable, latent response policies ("prevailing mindsets") that survive across model versions and can influence safety, governance, and potential echo chambers. There is a need for a way to systematically measure these stable biases at the provider level, without depending on ground-truth labels.

Method: The authors design an auditing framework based on psychometric latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty. They use forced-choice ordinal vignettes: models must choose among options designed to expose underlying tendencies. These options are masked with semantically orthogonal decoys and arranged with cryptographic permutation-invariance to prevent simple pattern exploitation. They then audit nine leading LLMs on dimensions such as Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization. Statistical analysis is performed using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) to separate item-level framing variance from stable provider-level signals.

Result: Analysis shows that while specific item framings produce high variance in responses, there is a robust and statistically significant "lab signal"—a provider-level cluster of behaviors that recurs across items and conditions. This indicates that each provider’s models share stable latent traits across versions. The framework successfully reveals clustering along dimensions like optimization bias and sycophancy without any ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLM provider ecosystems exhibit durable, latent behavioral signatures that go beyond isolated errors. These traits can act as compounding variables in complex, multi-layer AI architectures, raising the risk of recursive ideological echo chambers when the same provider’s models are used throughout the stack. The proposed psychometric auditing framework offers a way to detect and quantify such latent biases for governance and safety monitoring, suggesting that oversight should operate at the provider-ecosystem level, not just at the single-model or single-task level.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from standalone chat interfaces to foundational reasoning layers in multi-agent systems and recursive evaluation loops (LLM-as-a-judge), the detection of durable, provider-level behavioral signatures becomes a critical requirement for safety and governance. Traditional benchmarks measure transient task accuracy but fail to capture stable, latent response policies -- the ``prevailing mindsets'' embedded during training and alignment that outlive individual model versions.
  This paper introduces a novel auditing framework that utilizes psychometric measurement theory -- specifically latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty -- to quantify these tendencies without relying on ground-truth labels. Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization.
  Using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering. These findings demonstrate that in ``locked-in'' provider ecosystems, latent biases are not merely static errors but compounding variables that risk creating recursive ideological echo chambers in multi-layered AI architectures.

### [18] [What Makes a Good Doctor Response? An Analysis on a Romanian Telemedicine Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17194)
*Adrian Cosma,Cosmin Dumitrache,Emilian Radoi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study on what linguistic and contextual factors predict positive patient feedback in Romanian text-based telemedicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based telemedicine is widespread and clinicians are increasingly judged by patient ratings that often capture communication style rather than clinical quality. There is limited understanding, especially in non-English settings, of which features of written medical responses drive patient satisfaction, which is important both for fair evaluation of clinicians and for improving communication practices.

Method: The authors collected 77,334 anonymised Romanian patient question–doctor response pairs from a text-based telemedicine platform and modeled patient feedback as a binary variable (thumbs-up vs. everything else). They engineered mostly language-agnostic features about messages (length, structure, readability proxies), added Romanian LIWC psycholinguistic features and politeness/hedging markers, and included patient/clinician history features. They trained a classifier with a time-based train–test split, then used SHAP analyses to interpret feature importance and performed subgroup correlation analyses for specific linguistic markers.

Result: The classifier showed that patient and clinician history features (e.g., prior feedback patterns) were the strongest predictors of feedback, acting as powerful priors. Features derived from the actual response text were weaker but still contributed meaningfully. Politeness and hedging markers were consistently positively correlated with receiving positive feedback, while higher lexical diversity in responses was negatively correlated with positive feedback across subgroups.

Conclusion: Patient satisfaction in Romanian text-based telemedicine is driven largely by historical tendencies of individual patients and clinicians, but modifiable aspects of written communication still matter. Specifically, more polite and hedged language tends to improve feedback, whereas more lexically diverse (potentially more complex) language is associated with worse feedback. These findings suggest that platforms and institutions should be cautious in how they use ratings to evaluate clinicians and that training in clear, polite, and accessible written communication could enhance patient-perceived quality of care.

Abstract: Text-based telemedicine has become a common mode of care, requiring clinicians to deliver medical advice clearly and effectively in writing. As platforms increasingly rely on patient ratings and feedback, clinicians face growing pressure to maintain satisfaction scores, even though these evaluations often reflect communication quality more than clinical accuracy. We analyse patient satisfaction signals in Romanian text-based telemedicine. Using a sample of 77,334 anonymised patient question--doctor response pairs, we model feedback as a binary outcome, treating thumbs-up responses as positive and grouping negative or absent feedback into the other class. We extract interpretable, predominantly language-agnostic features (e.g., length, structural characteristics, readability proxies), along with Romanian LIWC psycholinguistic features and politeness/hedging markers where available. We train a classifier with a time-based split and perform SHAP-based analyses, which indicate that patient and clinician history features dominate prediction, functioning as strong priors, while characteristics of the response text provide a smaller but, crucially, actionable signal. In subgroup correlation analyses, politeness and hedging are consistently positively associated with patient feedback, whereas lexical diversity shows a negative association.

### [19] [Quantifying and Mitigating Socially Desirable Responding in LLMs: A Desirability-Matched Graded Forced-Choice Psychometric Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17262)
*Kensuke Okada,Yui Furukawa,Kyosuke Bunji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper proposes a psychometric framework to measure and reduce socially desirable responding (SDR) when using human questionnaires to evaluate LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly evaluated with human self-report questionnaires for traits, safety, and bias. These questionnaires assume honest responses, but LLMs tend to pick socially desirable answers, which can distort scores and invalidate conclusions. There is a need for a systematic way to measure and mitigate this socially desirable responding in LLM evaluations.

Method: 1) Quantification: Administer the same questionnaire to LLMs under two different prompts—one to answer HONESTly and one to answer in a FAKE-GOOD (socially desirable) way. Use item response theory (IRT) to estimate latent trait scores under both conditions and compute SDR as a direction-corrected standardized effect size. This allows comparisons across constructs, formats, and against human faking data.
2) Mitigation: Design a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five personality inventory. From an item pool, select 30 cross-domain item pairs using constrained optimization so that pairs are matched in social desirability, reducing the advantage of always picking the “good” option.

Result: Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs responding as synthetic personas with known target trait profiles, standard Likert questionnaires exhibit consistently large SDR effects (large differences between HONEST and FAKE-GOOD conditions). In contrast, the desirability-matched GFC format greatly reduces SDR while still allowing the recovered profiles to stay close to the intended personas.

Conclusion: Questionnaire-based LLM evaluations are highly vulnerable to socially desirable responding, which can be quantified via IRT-based SDR metrics and reduced using carefully constructed forced-choice instruments. However, there is a trade-off between minimizing SDR and accurately recovering target profiles that varies by model. The authors argue that LLM benchmarking and auditing with questionnaires should adopt SDR-aware designs and reporting practices.

Abstract: Human self-report questionnaires are increasingly used in NLP to benchmark and audit large language models (LLMs), from persona consistency to safety and bias assessments. Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs.

### [20] [Towards Cross-lingual Values Assessment: A Consensus-Pluralism Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17283)
*Yukun Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Jialong Tang,Yu Wan,Baosong Yang,Yiming Li,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents X-Value, a cross-lingual benchmark to evaluate how well LLMs can assess deeper human values in content, beyond explicit harms, and shows that current models perform poorly and inconsistently across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluations focus mostly on overt harms like hate speech or violence and largely ignore subtle, deeper value dimensions (e.g., fairness, autonomy, tradition) that content may encode. There is also a lack of systematic, cross-lingual benchmarks that consider global value diversity and distinguish between widely shared values and pluralistic, culturally variable ones. The authors aim to fill this gap so LLMs can better handle nuanced, value-related judgments worldwide.

Method: The authors build X-Value, a benchmark of 5,000+ question–answer pairs in 18 languages. Items are mapped to 7 value domains derived from Schwartz’s Theory of Basic Human Values and are labeled with easy or hard difficulty. They introduce a two-stage annotation framework: (1) classify each issue as belonging to global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion); (2) conduct multi-party annotation to identify and evaluate the latent values expressed in the content. They then systematically test state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark and compute accuracy, including per-language comparisons.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs achieve under 77% accuracy on X-Value, showing substantial room for improvement in nuanced value assessment. There are large performance gaps between languages, exceeding 20 percentage points in accuracy, revealing significant cross-lingual inconsistency in models’ value judgments.

Conclusion: X-Value exposes the limitations of current LLMs in performing fine-grained, cross-lingual value assessment and underscores the need to develop models and training methods that are more sensitive to deep human values and cultural diversity. The benchmark provides a publicly available resource to measure and drive progress in this direction.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal to content safety, current evaluation paradigms primarily focus on detecting explicit harms (e.g., violence or hate speech), neglecting the subtler value dimensions conveyed in digital content. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Value, a novel Cross-lingual Values Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess deep-level values of content from a global perspective. X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($ΔAcc > 20\%$). This work highlights the urgent need to improve the nuanced, values-aware content assessment capability of LLMs. Our X-Value is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Whitolf/X-Value.

### [21] [Representation Collapse in Machine Translation Through the Lens of Angular Dispersion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17287)
*Evgeniia Tokarchuk,Maya K. Nachesa,Sergey Troshin,Vlad Niculae*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how and why representation collapse happens inside Transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) models (both discrete and continuous-output, and also after quantization) and shows that a regularizer based on angular dispersion can prevent collapse and improve translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer NMT models, especially on high-resource data, achieve strong results but are typically trained with standard next-token prediction, which can cause internal representations—particularly in deeper layers—to collapse, i.e., become geometrically degenerate and underuse embedding space. This is even more problematic in continuous-output NMT, where a trivial solution is to map all outputs to the same vector. There is a need to understand these collapse dynamics and to find simple, effective ways to mitigate them while preserving or improving translation quality, including in quantized models.

Method: The authors empirically analyze representation collapse across layers during training in both discrete (standard) and continuous-output Transformer NMT models. They measure the geometric utilization of the representation space, focusing on deeper layers where collapse is most severe. They then incorporate an existing regularization technique that promotes angular dispersion among representations (encouraging diverse directions in the embedding space) and evaluate its effect on both collapse and translation performance. They further extend the study to quantized models, examining whether similar collapse patterns occur and whether the regularization retains its benefits after quantization.

Result: The study finds that representation collapse is particularly pronounced in deeper layers of Transformer NMT models, and is especially severe in end-to-end continuous-output NMT, where a trivial all-vectors-equal solution exists. Applying angular-dispersion-based regularization significantly reduces representation collapse and leads to empirical improvements in translation quality. The authors also observe that quantized NMT models display similar collapsing behavior and that the angular dispersion regularizer continues to mitigate collapse and maintain its translation quality benefits even after quantization.

Conclusion: Representation collapse is a substantial and layered phenomenon in Transformer-based NMT, particularly for continuous-output and quantized models. A relatively simple angular-dispersion regularization can effectively counteract this collapse, leading to better use of the representation space and improved translation performance. These findings suggest that monitoring and regularizing representation geometry should be an integral part of training both standard and quantized NMT systems.

Abstract: Modern neural translation models based on the Transformer architecture are known for their high performance, particularly when trained on high-resource datasets. A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization.

### [22] [Same Meaning, Different Scores: Lexical and Syntactic Sensitivity in LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17316)
*Bogdan Kostić,Conor Fallon,Julian Risch,Alexander Löser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tests how stable LLM benchmark evaluations are when prompts are minimally reworded, and finds that small, meaning-preserving changes can significantly hurt accuracy and reshuffle model rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks like MMLU and SQuAD are widely used to compare LLMs, but their reliability is under doubt because models can be overly sensitive to superficial prompt changes. The authors want to rigorously measure how much such shallow, meaning-preserving lexical and syntactic variations actually affect performance and rankings, and to understand whether current benchmarks truly capture robust language understanding rather than pattern-matching.

Method: The authors evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks: MMLU (multi-task knowledge), SQuAD (reading comprehension), and AMEGA (a complex evaluation suite). They generate controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent variations of benchmark items using two linguistically grounded pipelines: (1) synonym substitution for lexical perturbations, ensuring meaning preservation; and (2) dependency-parse-based syntactic transformations for structural perturbations. They then compare model accuracy and leaderboard rankings between original and perturbed datasets, and analyze how effects depend on task type and model size.

Result: Lexical perturbations via synonym substitution consistently cause substantial and statistically significant drops in performance for almost all models and tasks. Syntactic perturbations show mixed effects: sometimes degrading performance, sometimes even improving it, depending on task and model. Both types of perturbations can significantly change model leaderboards, especially on more complex tasks like MMLU and AMEGA. Robustness does not reliably improve with larger model size and depends strongly on the specific task and perturbation type.

Conclusion: Benchmark scores for LLMs are fragile with respect to minor, meaning-preserving changes in wording and syntax, so standard leaderboards are not stable indicators of true language competence. LLMs appear to rely heavily on surface lexical cues rather than deep, abstract linguistic understanding. The authors argue that robustness testing to such controlled perturbations should become a standard part of LLM evaluation and model comparison, and that current benchmarking practices likely overestimate genuine language understanding.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established standardized evaluation benchmarks as the primary instrument for model comparison. Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.

### [23] [RPDR: A Round-trip Prediction-Based Data Augmentation Framework for Long-Tail Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17366)
*Yiming Zhang,Siyue Zhang,Junbo Zhao,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RPDR, a data augmentation framework that improves dense retrievers for long-tail question answering by selecting easy-to-learn synthetic training data, achieving strong gains on PopQA and EntityQuestion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tail question answering is hard for LLMs and RAG systems because both models and dense retrievers struggle with rare or niche knowledge. Existing retrieval approaches like BM25, Contriver and standard dense retrievers do not generalize well to extremely long-tail entities, limiting the effectiveness of RAG in real-world, open-domain settings. The authors are motivated to create a method that specifically enhances dense retrievers on these rare cases without requiring massive amounts of additional labeled data.

Method: They introduce RPDR, a data augmentation framework with three main stages: (1) Synthetic data generation, where additional training pairs are produced, presumably via LLMs or other automatic methods; (2) Data selection via a Round-Trip prediction mechanism that scores synthetic instances by how easy they are to learn, keeping only high-quality, easy instances that are likely to benefit the retriever; (3) Retriever training on this curated subset of synthetic data so that the dense retriever better captures signals useful for long-tail questions. They also explore a dynamic routing mechanism that routes incoming queries to specialized retrieval modules based on their characteristics, further improving performance.

Result: On two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, RPDR significantly outperforms strong baselines such as BM25 and Contriver, with particularly large gains on extremely long-tail categories (i.e., the rarest entities/questions). Human analyses are conducted to assess when and why RPDR helps or fails, revealing both strengths and remaining weaknesses in handling long-tail knowledge.

Conclusion: RPDR is an effective way to boost dense retrievers for long-tail question answering by focusing training on easy-to-learn synthetic instances, leading to substantial gains over existing methods on benchmarks like PopQA and EntityQuestion. The analysis suggests that combining RPDR with a dynamic routing architecture that leverages specialized retrieval modules can further enhance retrieval quality on rare knowledge, though some limitations remain and invite future improvement.

Abstract: Long-tail question answering presents significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to their limited ability to acquire and accurately recall less common knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in mitigating this limitation by integrating external retrieval mechanisms. However, dense retrieval models often face the same difficulties when generalizing to rare or niche knowledge. In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance.

### [24] [The Role of the Availability Heuristic in Multiple-Choice Answering Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17377)
*Leonidas Zotos,Hedderik van Rijn,Malvina Nissim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether the availability heuristic can be exploited to improve multiple-choice guessing by measuring how prevalent answer options are in large text corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often guess on multiple-choice questions when unsure of the correct answer. The availability heuristic posits that people judge likelihood or truth based on how easily examples come to mind, often linked to frequency of exposure. The authors want to know if this cognitive bias can be quantitatively modeled using text corpora and whether “choose what comes most readily to mind” is actually an effective MCQ strategy. They also want to understand how this property appears in both expert-written and LLM-generated items, and how it should inform computational models of test-taking behavior.

Method: The authors operationalize cognitive availability as corpus-based prevalence of the concepts represented by each MCQ option. Using large text corpora, particularly Wikipedia, they compute an availability measure for each option in multiple large MCQ datasets. They then simulate a simple test-taking strategy: always pick the option with the highest availability score, regardless of the stem content. They compare the resulting accuracy to a random guessing baseline. They also repeat the analysis on MCQs whose options are generated by large language models, comparing availability patterns of correct vs. incorrect options to those found in expert-crafted items.

Result: Across three large MCQ sets, correct answers are consistently and significantly more available in the corpus than distractors, independent of the question stem. The naïve strategy of always selecting the most available option yields scores 13.5%–32.9% higher than random guessing. For LLM-generated MCQ options, the same relative pattern holds: correct answers tend to be more available than incorrect alternatives, despite LLMs being trained on large-scale textual data with frequency-driven learning dynamics.

Conclusion: Simply picking the most cognitively available option, approximated via corpus prevalence, is substantially better than random guessing on MCQs. Correct answers tend to be more prevalent in large text corpora than distractors, a pattern that holds for both expert-authored and LLM-generated questions. These results imply that availability, as instantiated by text frequency, is an important factor in test performance and should be explicitly incorporated into computational models of student behavior and MCQ design, especially in contexts where guessing and heuristic-driven answering are common.

Abstract: When students are unsure of the correct answer to a multiple-choice question (MCQ), guessing is common practice. The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour.

### [25] [Diverse Word Choices, Same Reference: Annotating Lexically-Rich Cross-Document Coreference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17424)
*Anastasia Zhukova,Felix Hamborg,Karsten Donnay,Norman Meuschke,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They redesign cross-document coreference annotation for news, capturing both identical and closely related mentions (discourse elements) to better handle lexical and framing variation, and reannotate two datasets accordingly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CDCR datasets focus mostly on event coreference and use a narrow identity-based notion of coreference, which is insufficient for analyzing polarized and stylistically varied news coverage where the same actors and events are framed differently with diverse wording.

Method: They propose a new CDCR annotation scheme where coreference chains are treated as discourse elements (DEs), which include both identity and near-identity relations (e.g., chaining phrases like "the caravan", "asylum seekers", and "those contemplating illegal entry"). They reannotate the NewsWCL50 dataset and a subset of ECB+ with a unified codebook, then evaluate the new annotations using lexical diversity measures and a simple same-head-lemma baseline model.

Result: The reannotated versions of NewsWCL50 and ECB+ exhibit similar properties, with diversity and difficulty measures falling between those of the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, indicating that the new scheme yields balanced datasets that better reflect discourse-level variation while remaining tractable for models.

Conclusion: The revised annotation scheme and resulting datasets provide a more discourse-aware and lexically diverse benchmark for CDCR in news, enabling models to better capture framing and wording variation across documents while preserving fine-grained discourse elements.

Abstract: Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) identifies and links mentions of the same entities and events across related documents, enabling content analysis that aggregates information at the level of discourse participants. However, existing datasets primarily focus on event resolution and employ a narrow definition of coreference, which limits their effectiveness in analyzing diverse and polarized news coverage where wording varies widely. This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking "the caravan" - "asylum seekers" - "those contemplating illegal entry", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline. The results show that the reannotated datasets align closely, falling between the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, thereby supporting balanced and discourse-aware CDCR research in the news domain.

### [26] [Evaluating Extremely Low-Resource Machine Translation: A Comparative Study of ChrF++ and BLEU Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17425)
*Sanjeev Kumar,Preethi Jyothi,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares BLEU and ChrF++ for evaluating machine translation in extremely low-resource languages and shows that BLEU, though giving lower scores, adds valuable lexical-precision information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MT metrics like BLEU are known to work well in high-resource settings but behave unreliably for extremely low-resource languages. Many recent works have defaulted to ChrF++ alone, assuming it is superior in these contexts, but without detailed analysis of its behavior on typical LLM/NMT errors in such languages. There is thus a need to systematically study how different automatic metrics react to common translation artifacts in ELRL scenarios, especially for under-studied Indo-Aryan languages like Magahi, Bhojpuri, and Chhattisgarhi.

Method: The authors conduct a comparative evaluation of two automatic MT metrics—BLEU (n-gram-based, word-level) and ChrF++ (character-level)—on machine translation outputs for three extremely low-resource Indo-Aryan languages: Magahi, Bhojpuri, and Chhattisgarhi. They analyze how both metrics respond to various translation artifacts such as hallucinations, repetition, copying from the source, and diacritic (matra) variations. The study covers outputs from both large language models (LLMs) and neural MT systems, allowing them to contrast metric behavior across model types and error patterns.

Result: The analysis reveals that in ELRL conditions, BLEU typically yields lower absolute scores than ChrF++, but its word-level n-gram precision captures lexical accuracy aspects that ChrF++ can obscure. The metrics react differently to specific artifacts: character-level ChrF++ is more tolerant of orthographic variation (e.g., diacritics) and minor edits, whereas BLEU is more sensitive to lexical choice and penalizes hallucinations and source copying differently. This complementary behavior means relying only on ChrF++ can lead to incomplete or misleading assessments of MT quality in ELRL settings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that in extremely low-resource MT scenarios, BLEU should not be discarded simply because it produces lower scores or is known to underperform in other respects. Instead, BLEU and ChrF++ provide complementary signals: ChrF++ better accounts for character-level similarity and diacritic variations, while BLEU contributes crucial lexical-precision insight. For practical MT evaluation in ELRLs, especially for LLM and NMT outputs, the authors recommend using both metrics together to obtain a more interpretable and reliable assessment of translation quality.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in extremely low-resource language (ELRL) scenarios poses unique challenges, as widely used metrics such as BLEU, effective in high-resource settings, often misrepresent quality in data-scarce contexts. This work presents a comparative analysis of BLEU, an n-gram-based metric, and ChrF++, a character-based metric, for MT evaluation in ELRL settings. We examine how each metric responds to translation artifacts, including hallucinations, repetition, source-text copying, and diacritic (\textit{matra}) variations across three ELRLs: Magahi, Bhojpuri, and Chhattisgarhi, with a focus on outputs from large language models (LLMs) and neural MT (NMT) systems. While recent work often relies solely on ChrF++, our findings show that BLEU, despite its lower absolute scores, provides complementary lexical-precision insights that improve interpretability.

### [27] [Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification for Long-Form Language Model Outputs: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17431)
*Dylan Bouchard,Mohit Singh Chauhan,Viren Bajaj,David Skarbrevik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a general framework and taxonomy for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in long-form LLM outputs, shows how various black-box, consistency-based hallucination detectors fit into it, and empirically evaluates design choices for detecting hallucinations and improving factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification and hallucination detection methods for LLMs are mainly tailored to short answers or single-span predictions, and they do not transfer well to long-form, multi-sentence or multi-claim generations. Long-form outputs require fine-grained, structured ways to localize hallucinations and quantify uncertainty at the level of claims while aggregating to whole-response scores. There is also fragmentation in the literature, with many methods proposed without a unifying framework, making comparison and method selection difficult.

Method: The authors introduce a three-stage taxonomy for fine-grained UQ in long-form LLM generations: (1) response decomposition (how to split a long answer into units such as sentences, atomic claims, etc.), (2) unit-level scoring (how to assign an uncertainty or factuality score to each unit, e.g., via consistency checks, claim-response entailment, or other black-box scorers), and (3) response-level aggregation (how to combine unit scores into an overall uncertainty score or to control decoding). They formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers—generalizing and extending prior methods—centered around the idea of checking consistency or entailment between generated claims and evidence (e.g., the original prompt, retrieved context, or alternative generations). They then instantiate multiple design choices within this framework and evaluate them across different LLMs, datasets, and tasks, including settings where uncertainty is used during decoding to guide generation (uncertainty-aware decoding).

Result: Empirically, they find: (1) simple claim-response entailment scoring is consistently as strong as or better than more elaborate claim-level scoring methods, (2) decomposing responses into claims and scoring at the claim level generally outperforms coarser sentence-level scoring, and (3) incorporating uncertainty into the decoding process—uncertainty-aware decoding—substantially improves the factuality of long-form LLM outputs across models and datasets. These results validate the framework’s design choices and show that relatively simple, well-structured methods can be highly effective.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a structured, three-stage approach to fine-grained uncertainty quantification is key for handling hallucinations in long-form LLM outputs. Their taxonomy unifies and clarifies relationships between previously disparate methods, facilitating fair comparison and principled design of new techniques. Practically, they recommend claim-level decomposition and claim-response entailment scoring as strong baselines, and they highlight uncertainty-aware decoding as an effective strategy for improving factual correctness in long-form generation tasks.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has emerged as an effective approach to closed-book hallucination detection for LLMs, but existing methods are largely designed for short-form outputs and do not generalize well to long-form generation. We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ.

### [28] [AIDG: Evaluating Asymmetry Between Information Extraction and Containment in Multi-Turn Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17443)
*Adib Sakhawat,Fardeen Sadab,Rakin Shahriar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIDG, a game-theoretic, multi-turn evaluation framework showing that LLMs are much better at strategically hiding information than actively deducing it, revealing major weaknesses in global state tracking and strategic inquiry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks are mostly static and single-turn, which fails to capture strategic, multi-step reasoning in interactive settings. The authors want to evaluate how well LLMs can not only generate answers but also engage in adversarial, game-like dialogues that require both extracting hidden information and protecting known information. They focus on understanding whether models are symmetrically capable at offensive deduction versus defensive containment in realistic conversational games.

Method: They design AIDG, an adversarial information deduction game framework with two tasks. AIDG-I is a social deduction setup measuring pragmatic strategy: one side tries to infer hidden information from an opponent, while the other tries to maintain a consistent state and avoid revealing it. AIDG-II is a structured variant similar to "20 Questions" that stresses constraint satisfaction and systematic querying. They run 439 game instances using six state-of-the-art LLMs in both attacker (deduction) and defender (containment) roles. They compute ELO ratings to compare capabilities, and analyze logs to identify failure modes, quantifying information dynamics (e.g., confirming hypotheses vs. blind guessing) and constraint adherence (instruction-following under conversational load). Statistical tests (e.g., Cohen's d, effectiveness ratios, and percentages of deductive failures) characterize the performance gaps.

Result: LLMs show a strong asymmetry: they are significantly better at defending/containing information than at attacking/deducing it, with an approximate 350 ELO edge on defense and a very large effect size (Cohen's d = 5.47). Confirmation-based strategies in deduction are 7.75 times more effective than unguided, blind deduction, indicating that how the model structures its queries critically affects performance (p < 0.00001). Nonetheless, models frequently fail to maintain task constraints in longer conversations; degraded instruction-following under load explains about 41.3% of deductive failures. Overall, models maintain local coherence when hiding information but fail at global, long-horizon state tracking when trying to infer hidden targets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current frontier LLMs are strategically unbalanced: they excel at local defensive coherence and information containment but are comparatively weak at global, planful information gathering and deduction in multi-turn settings. This limitation stems from two main bottlenecks: poor management of information dynamics (inefficient questioning and overuse of blind guesses) and declining adherence to constraints as conversations grow more complex. The authors imply that future LLM development and evaluation should target improved global state tracking, robust instruction-following under conversational load, and better support for structured, confirmation-based inquiry strategies, rather than relying solely on static or single-turn benchmarks.

Abstract: Evaluating the strategic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires moving beyond static benchmarks to dynamic, multi-turn interactions. We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured "20 Questions" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry.

### [29] [ABCD: All Biases Come Disguised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17445)
*Mateusz Nowak,Xavier Cadet,Peter Chin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and mitigates position- and label-based biases in LLM multiple-choice evaluation by introducing an evaluation protocol that removes reliance on option labels and positions, using sentence similarity to match generated answers to choices, thereby making MCQ benchmarks more robust to answer permutations with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MCQ benchmarks for LLMs are confounded by artifacts: models may exploit superficial patterns such as option position, label tokens (A/B/C/D), or the distribution of correct answers in few-shot exemplars instead of genuinely reasoning over content. Synthetic tests (NonsenseQA) reveal that models can perform above chance even when content is meaningless, suggesting strong positional and labeling biases. This undermines the reliability and fairness of current evaluation protocols and motivates the need for a more bias-resistant method that better reflects true reasoning and knowledge abilities.

Method: The authors first construct a synthetic benchmark, NonsenseQA, where answer content is semantically meaningless, to diagnose label-position-few-shot-prompt biases in different LLMs. They systematically vary answer permutations, option labels, and few-shot distributions to quantify how much each factor affects performance. To mitigate these biases, they propose a new evaluation protocol that (1) replaces standard ordered labels (A/B/C/D) with uniform, unordered labels, and (2) instructs the LLM to output the full answer text rather than a label. A separate sentence similarity model is then used to match the model’s generated answer to the closest option, allowing scoring without relying on label prediction. They further run ablations over different embedding models and similarity functions to assess robustness and sensitivity of the protocol.

Result: Using NonsenseQA and multiple standard MCQ benchmarks across several LLMs, the proposed protocol yields significantly reduced sensitivity to permutations of answer choices: mean accuracy variance across permutations is reduced by about 3× compared to standard evaluation. This robustness comes with only a minimal decrease in mean accuracy, indicating that most of the original performance is preserved when positional and label-based shortcuts are removed. Ablation experiments show that different embedding models and similarity metrics have limited impact on robustness, confirming that the gains primarily stem from decoupling evaluation from option labels and positions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that conventional MCQ evaluation of LLMs is substantially confounded by label and position artifacts, which can mask or inflate true model capabilities. By removing dependence on option labels and ordering and instead using a simple similarity-based mapping from free-form answers to options, evaluations become far less sensitive to answer permutations while largely preserving performance levels. This bias-reduced protocol exposes a more faithful picture of LLM reasoning and can be adopted broadly across benchmarks and models to obtain more robust and reliable assessments. The method is simple, model-agnostic, and more robust than standard protocols across a range of embedding models and similarity functions.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have been a standard evaluation practice for measuring LLMs' ability to reason and answer knowledge-based questions. Through a synthetic NonsenseQA benchmark, we observe that different LLMs exhibit varying degrees of label-position-few-shot-prompt bias, where the model either uses the answer position, the label in front of the answer, the distributions of correct answers present in the few-shot prompt, or a combination of all to answer each MCQ question. We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance. Through ablation studies on various embedding models and similarity functions, we show that the method is more robust than the standard ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an entropy-based, unsupervised framework (EUDS) to select high-value training data for fine-tuning language models, cutting compute costs and data requirements while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning modern language models is increasingly constrained by both compute and high-quality data availability. Existing data selection methods often depend on expensive computations (e.g., repeated model passes, gradients, or large teacher models), which contradicts the goal of efficiency, especially in compute-constrained settings. At the same time, while LLMs help with data generation, we still lack cheap and reliable ways to assess which data are actually useful to train on. The paper is motivated by the need for a simple, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient mechanism to select a subset of training data that preserves model performance while reducing training cost.

Method: The authors propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS). The core idea is to use uncertainty estimates—measured via entropy of the model’s predictive distribution—on unlabeled or weakly labeled data to identify and select the most informative or usable samples for fine-tuning. The method operates without requiring task-specific supervision for the selection step, making it unsupervised. It defines a data-filtering criterion based on entropy, derives a selection strategy that balances informativeness and reliability, and integrates this into the fine-tuning pipeline so that only the filtered subset is used for training. The framework is designed to be lightweight, requiring relatively few forward passes and no heavy additional models or gradient-based computations.

Result: Across three task families—sentiment analysis, topic classification, and question answering—the EUDS framework yields competitive or improved performance compared to baselines while using fewer training examples. Experiments show that EUDS can substantially cut the number of training samples and associated compute, yet maintain or even enhance accuracy. The paper reports reduced training time and overall computational cost, with empirical curves demonstrating more favorable trade-offs between performance and data/compute usage compared to standard full-data fine-tuning and other selection strategies. Theoretical analysis supports that the entropy-based criterion is aligned with selecting high-usability data under uncertainty modeling assumptions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that entropy-based unsupervised data selection offers an effective and practical approach for fine-tuning language models in compute-constrained environments. By leveraging uncertainty (entropy) as a proxy for data usability, EUDS can filter large raw datasets into compact, high-value training subsets, significantly reducing computational overhead and training time without sacrificing performance. This framework provides a general, model-agnostic strategy that can be applied across various NLP tasks, and it highlights the broader importance of coupling data selection with principled uncertainty estimation in modern LM training pipelines.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) increasingly require two critical resources: computational resources and data resources. Data selection techniques can effectively reduce the amount of training data required for fine-tuning LMs. However, their effectiveness is closely related to computational resources, which always require a high compute budget. Owing to the resource limitations in practical fine-tuning scenario, we systematically reveal the relationship between data selection and uncertainty estimation of selected data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task. This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. EUDS significantly reduces computational costs and improves training time efficiency with less data requirement. This provides an innovative solution for the efficient fine-tuning of LMs in the compute-constrained scenarios.

### [31] [PEACE 2.0: Grounded Explanations and Counter-Speech for Combating Hate Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17467)
*Greta Damo,Stéphane Petiot,Elena Cabrio,Serena Villata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEACE 2.0, a system that both explains why content is hateful and generates evidence-grounded counter-speech using a RAG pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLP systems can detect hate speech but do little to explain why content is hateful or to generate appropriate, factual responses (counter-speech), especially for implicit hate. There is a need for tools that not only classify but also support constructive, evidence-based interventions.

Method: The authors design PEACE 2.0, a tool built around a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It retrieves external evidence and facts, uses them to explain why a message is or is not hateful, generates counter-speech grounded in that evidence, and analyzes properties of the produced counter-speech. It targets both explicit and implicit hate speech scenarios.

Result: PEACE 2.0 is able to: (1) link its hate-speech explanations to external factual evidence, (2) generate counter-speech that is similarly grounded, and (3) provide insights into the characteristics of different counter-speech strategies. It supports analysis and response across a variety of hate expressions.

Conclusion: Integrating RAG-based evidence retrieval with explanation and generation capabilities allows PEACE 2.0 to move beyond simple hate speech detection toward a comprehensive framework for understanding and responding to hateful content, including subtle or implicit forms.

Abstract: The increasing volume of hate speech on online platforms poses significant societal challenges. While the Natural Language Processing community has developed effective methods to automatically detect the presence of hate speech, responses to it, called counter-speech, are still an open challenge. We present PEACE 2.0, a novel tool that, besides analysing and explaining why a message is considered hateful or not, also generates a response to it. More specifically, PEACE 2.0 has three main new functionalities: leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline i) to ground HS explanations into evidence and facts, ii) to automatically generate evidence-grounded counter-speech, and iii) exploring the characteristics of counter-speech replies. By integrating these capabilities, PEACE 2.0 enables in-depth analysis and response generation for both explicit and implicit hateful messages.

### [32] [Auditing Reciprocal Sentiment Alignment: Inversion Risk, Dialect Representation and Intent Misalignment in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17469)
*Nusrat Jahan Lia,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how well AI sentiment models stay aligned with human intent across languages, finding large cross-lingual failures between Bengali and English sentiment interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems that appear aligned and trustworthy in one language (often English) maintain that alignment and trustworthiness when interacting with users in another language, specifically Bengali, and to expose hidden safety risks caused by cross-lingual sentiment misalignment.

Method: The authors benchmark four transformer-based language models, including a compressed model (mDistilBERT) and a regional model (IndicBERT), on Bengali-English sentiment tasks. They analyze error patterns such as polarity flips, affective intensity changes, and performance across different registers of Bengali (e.g., formal Sadhu vs. more modern varieties). They then quantify metrics like Sentiment Inversion Rate, asymmetries in affective strength, and error rates by language variety.

Result: They find that the compressed model mDistilBERT has a 28.7% Sentiment Inversion Rate, frequently flipping positive sentiment to negative and vice versa. They detect "Asymmetric Empathy," where certain models systematically weaken or exaggerate the emotional tone of Bengali relative to English. They also uncover a strong "Modern Bias" in IndicBERT, which shows a 57% higher alignment error when processing formal Sadhu Bengali compared to other varieties.

Conclusion: Current cross-lingual alignment approaches and model compression strategies fail to preserve emotional fidelity across languages and dialects, undermining human-AI trust. The authors argue for pluralistic, culturally grounded alignment methods that explicitly respect linguistic and dialectal diversity, and they recommend that alignment benchmarks add "Affective Stability" metrics that penalize sentiment polarity inversions, especially in low-resource and dialectal settings.

Abstract: The core theme of bidirectional alignment is ensuring that AI systems accurately understand human intent and that humans can trust AI behavior. However, this loop fractures significantly across language barriers. Our research addresses Cross-Lingual Sentiment Misalignment between Bengali and English by benchmarking four transformer architectures. We reveal severe safety and representational failures in current alignment paradigms. We demonstrate that compressed model (mDistilBERT) exhibits 28.7% "Sentiment Inversion Rate," fundamentally misinterpreting positive user intent as negative (or vice versa). Furthermore, we identify systemic nuances affecting human-AI trust, including "Asymmetric Empathy" where some models systematically dampen and others amplify the affective weight of Bengali text relative to its English counterpart. Finally, we reveal a "Modern Bias" in the regional model (IndicBERT), which shows a 57% increase in alignment error when processing formal (Sadhu) Bengali. We argue that equitable human-AI co-evolution requires pluralistic, culturally grounded alignment that respects language and dialectal diversity over universal compression, which fails to preserve the emotional fidelity required for reciprocal human-AI trust. We recommend that alignment benchmarks incorporate "Affective Stability" metrics that explicitly penalize polarity inversions in low-resource and dialectal contexts.

### [33] [Small LLMs for Medical NLP: a Systematic Analysis of Few-Shot, Constraint Decoding, Fine-Tuning and Continual Pre-Training in Italian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17475)
*Pietro Ferrazzi,Mattia Franzin,Alberto Lavelli,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies whether comparatively small (~1B parameter) LLMs can handle a wide range of Italian clinical NLP tasks competitively with much larger models, finding that, with proper adaptation, they can even outperform 32B-parameter baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLMs work very well on medical NLP tasks, their high computational cost makes them difficult to deploy in real clinical environments, which often have limited hardware and strict latency/privacy constraints. There is a need to understand if much smaller, more efficient models can reach similar performance, and which adaptation strategies (prompting vs. fine-tuning vs. continual pretraining) are most effective for medical Italian NLP, an under-resourced language/domain combination.

Method: The authors benchmark three small LLM families (Llama-3, Gemma-3, Qwen3) around 1B parameters on 20 Italian clinical NLP tasks: NER, relation extraction, case report form filling, QA, and argument mining. They systematically compare inference-only adaptation (few-shot prompting, constrained decoding) against training-based adaptation (supervised fine-tuning on task data, and domain-specific continual pretraining on large Italian medical corpora). They then measure performance against larger baselines, including Qwen3-32B, and release curated datasets and trained models.

Result: Supervised fine-tuning of small LLMs produces the best overall performance across tasks. When training resources are limited, combining few-shot prompting with constraint decoding yields strong results without full fine-tuning. The best small configuration, Qwen3-1.7B with appropriate adaptation, achieves an average performance that is 9.2 points higher than a much larger Qwen3-32B baseline across the evaluated tasks. The authors also compile and release all publicly available Italian medical NLP datasets used, along with new large-scale Italian clinical text corpora for continual pretraining.

Conclusion: Small (~1B) LLMs, when carefully adapted, can be highly competitive for Italian medical NLP and can even outperform substantially larger models, making them attractive for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Fine-tuning is the most effective adaptation strategy, but well-designed prompting and constrained decoding provide viable alternatives when training is not possible. The released datasets, models, and Italian clinical corpora aim to foster further research and practical applications in medical NLP for Italian.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently excel in diverse medical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial computational requirements often limit deployment in real-world healthcare settings. In this work, we investigate whether "small" LLMs (around one billion parameters) can effectively perform medical tasks while maintaining competitive accuracy. We evaluate models from three major families-Llama-3, Gemma-3, and Qwen3-across 20 clinical NLP tasks among Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Case Report Form Filling, Question Answering, and Argument Mining. We systematically compare a range of adaptation strategies, both at inference time (few-shot prompting, constraint decoding) and at training time (supervised fine-tuning, continual pretraining). Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective approach, while the combination of few-shot prompting and constraint decoding offers strong lower-resource alternatives. Our results show that small LLMs can match or even surpass larger baselines, with our best configuration based on Qwen3-1.7B achieving an average score +9.2 points higher than Qwen3-32B. We release a comprehensive collection of all the publicly available Italian medical datasets for NLP tasks, together with our top-performing models. Furthermore, we release an Italian dataset of 126M words from the Emergency Department of an Italian Hospital, and 175M words from various sources that we used for continual pre-training.

### [34] [Bridging the Domain Divide: Supervised vs. Zero-Shot Clinical Section Segmentation from MIMIC-III to Obstetrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17513)
*Baris Karacan,Barbara Di Eugenio,Patrick Thornton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves clinical note section segmentation by introducing a new obstetrics dataset, benchmarking supervised transformer models in- and out-of-domain, and comparing them against zero-shot LLMs, finding that LLMs are more robust out-of-domain if hallucinated headers are corrected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical free-text notes are crucial for patient care and downstream NLP tasks, and they are typically organized into labeled sections. Existing segmentation models are mostly trained on MIMIC-III and may not generalize to other medical domains, with little work on obstetrics and on directly comparing supervised models to zero-shot LLMs. The authors aim to fill these gaps.

Method: 1) Curate and de-identify a new obstetrics clinical notes dataset with section labels. 2) Train and systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised section segmentation models on an in-domain subset of MIMIC-III and test them both in-domain and out-of-domain on the obstetrics dataset. 3) Evaluate zero-shot large language models on the same segmentation task and conduct a head-to-head comparison against supervised models, including analysis of hallucinated section headers and their correction.

Result: Supervised transformer models achieve strong performance when evaluated in-domain on MIMIC-III, but their performance degrades substantially when applied out-of-domain to the obstetrics dataset. Zero-shot large language models, in contrast, show better robustness and adaptability to the out-of-domain obstetrics notes, provided that hallucinated section headers are identified and corrected. This leads to competitive or superior out-of-domain segmentation performance relative to supervised models.

Conclusion: The study shows that domain shift significantly harms supervised clinical section segmentation models trained on standard corpora like MIMIC-III, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets such as the proposed obstetrics corpus. It also demonstrates that zero-shot large language models are a promising solution for generalizing clinical section segmentation to new domains, as long as mechanisms are in place to manage and correct their tendency to hallucinate section headers.

Abstract: Clinical free-text notes contain vital patient information. They are structured into labelled sections; recognizing these sections has been shown to support clinical decision-making and downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we advance clinical section segmentation through three key contributions. First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed.

### [35] [Using LLMs for Knowledge Component-level Correctness Labeling in Open-ended Coding Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17542)
*Zhangqi Duan,Arnav Kankaria,Dhruv Kartik,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework that uses large language models to infer fine-grained, knowledge-component-level correctness from student programming code, yielding better learning curves and predictive performance than problem-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many student modeling and learning analytics methods rely on fine-grained skill or knowledge component (KC) representations, but real-world datasets rarely contain KC-level correctness labels. This scarcity is especially acute in open-ended programming tasks, where a single solution can involve multiple KCs at once. Naively assigning problem-level correctness to all KCs hides partial mastery and produces poorly fitted learning curves, which undermines accurate modeling of learning and limits the usefulness of analytics and tutoring systems. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by automatically obtaining accurate KC-level labels from student work.

Method: The authors propose an automated framework that applies large language models to student-written code in order to determine, for each associated knowledge component, whether it has been correctly applied. In addition to basic KC-level correctness labeling, they design a temporal, context-aware Code–KC mapping mechanism that adapts the mapping between KCs and code elements based on the student’s evolving work over time. They then evaluate these LLM-derived KC labels using learning-curve analyses under the power law of practice and predictive modeling with the Additive Factors Model, comparing against baselines that propagate problem-level correctness to all KCs.

Result: The LLM-based framework produces KC-level correctness labels that yield learning curves more aligned with cognitive theory (e.g., smoother, more monotonic improvement) than those derived from naive problem-level label propagation. Predictive performance in the Additive Factors Model improves when using these refined KC labels, indicating better modeling of student knowledge and performance. Human evaluation shows substantial agreement between LLM-generated labels and expert annotations, supporting the validity of the automated approach.

Conclusion: Automatically inferring knowledge-component-level correctness from student code with large language models is feasible and beneficial. The proposed framework generates KC labels that support better-fitted, theory-consistent learning curves and improved predictive modeling compared to conventional problem-level labeling. This suggests that LLM-based labeling can help overcome the lack of fine-grained annotations in real-world programming datasets and enhance student modeling and learning analytics for open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained skill representations, commonly referred to as knowledge components (KCs), are fundamental to many approaches in student modeling and learning analytics. However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.

### [36] [Learning to Stay Safe: Adaptive Regularization Against Safety Degradation during Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17546)
*Jyotin Goel,Souvik Maji,Pratik Mazumder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive regularization framework that keeps instruction-tuned language models safe during further fine-tuning by dynamically constraining high-risk updates while allowing low-risk updates to proceed normally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-following language models, though trained to be helpful and safe, can become less safe when further fine-tuned, even with benign data, and especially under adversarial fine-tuning. Existing defenses either do not sufficiently prevent this safety degradation or introduce a strong trade-off, sacrificing model utility to maintain safety. The authors aim to develop a method that maintains safety throughout fine-tuning without harming downstream performance or adding inference-time overhead.

Method: The authors introduce an adaptive regularization training framework that adjusts the strength of regularization based on an estimated safety risk of each training batch or update. They explore two ways to estimate safety risk during training: (1) a judge-based Safety Critic that scores the potential harm of training batches at a high level, and (2) an activation-based risk predictor, which is a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to infer whether an input likely carries harmful intent. The risk signal is then used to constrain higher-risk gradient updates to stay close to a known-safe reference policy via stronger regularization, while low-risk updates are allowed to follow standard fine-tuning dynamics with weaker or no additional regularization.

Result: Empirical experiments across multiple model families and several attack scenarios show that harmful intent is predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge-based scores can provide high-recall safety signals. Using either the Safety Critic or the activation-based risk predictor for adaptive regularization consistently reduces attack success rates relative to standard fine-tuning, while largely preserving downstream task performance. The method does not introduce additional inference-time cost because all safety adaptation happens during training.

Conclusion: Adaptive regularization based on dynamic safety risk estimation offers a principled and effective way to keep instruction-following language models aligned during fine-tuning. By constraining only high-risk updates toward a safe reference policy, the method maintains or improves safety without sacrificing utility or increasing inference-time overhead, providing a practical defense against safety degradation under both benign and adversarial fine-tuning.

Abstract: Instruction-following language models are trained to be helpful and safe, yet their safety behavior can deteriorate under benign fine-tuning and worsen under adversarial updates. Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.

### [37] [Modeling Distinct Human Interaction in Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17588)
*Faria Huq,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Zhanqiu Guo,Venu Arvind Arangarajan,Tianyue Ou,Frank Xu,Shuyan Zhou,Graham Neubig,Jeffrey P. Bigham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies when and how humans intervene while working with autonomous web agents, builds a dataset of real interactions, models user intervention patterns with language models, and shows that intervention-aware agents are more accurate and more useful to users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous web agents are improving quickly, but they still need humans to guide preferences, correct mistakes, and handle edge cases. Existing systems neither understand nor predict when users will step in, so they may continue autonomously through critical decisions or bother users with unnecessary confirmation. This lack of principled modeling of human intervention limits how collaborative and user-friendly these agents can be. The paper aims to formally define and predict human intervention behavior to create more adaptive, collaborative web agents.

Method: The authors (1) define the task of modeling human intervention in collaborative web navigation; (2) collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories with over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions; (3) analyze the data and identify four patterns of user-agent interaction: hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover; (4) train language models to predict when users are likely to intervene, conditioning on interaction histories and inferred user styles; and (5) integrate these intervention-aware models into live web navigation agents and test them in a user study.

Result: Language models trained with awareness of user intervention patterns achieve a 61.4–63.4% improvement in predicting when users will intervene compared to base LMs. When these models are deployed in real web navigation agents and evaluated with users, the intervention-aware agents yield a 26.5% increase in user-rated usefulness. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling human intervention behavior significantly improves both predictive accuracy and perceived agent quality.

Conclusion: Structured modeling of human intervention in web navigation allows agents to better anticipate and adapt to user behavior. By learning distinct user interaction styles and predicting likely intervention points, autonomous agents can become more collaborative and useful. The CowCorpus dataset and the proposed modeling approach show that integrating human behavior patterns into agent design leads to more adaptive human-AI collaboration in web tasks.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous web agents, human involvement remains essential for shaping preferences and correcting agent behavior as tasks unfold. However, current agentic systems lack a principled understanding of when and why humans intervene, often proceeding autonomously past critical decision points or requesting unnecessary confirmation. In this work, we introduce the task of modeling human intervention to support collaborative web task execution. We collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories containing over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions. We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness. Together, our results show structured modeling of human intervention leads to more adaptive, collaborative agents.

### [38] [The Cascade Equivalence Hypothesis: When Do Speech LLMs Behave Like ASR$\rightarrow$LLM Pipelines?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17598)
*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that most current speech large language models (speech LLMs) behave just like a simple pipeline of automatic speech recognition (ASR) followed by a text LLM, rather than doing deeper, direct reasoning on audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether speech LLMs truly leverage raw audio in a fundamentally different way from standard ASR→LLM cascades, or if they are effectively just doing implicit transcription internally, which would question their added value and robustness, especially under noisy conditions.

Method: The authors perform matched-backbone experiments across four different speech LLMs and six tasks, carefully controlling for the text LLM backbone by pairing each speech LLM with a Whisper→same-LLM cascade. They compare behavior statistically (e.g., agreement metrics like Cohen’s kappa), inspect internal representations using logit lens to see if textual forms emerge in hidden states, and apply LEACE concept erasure to selectively remove text features and test causal necessity of text representations for task performance.

Result: For Ultravox, behavior is statistically indistinguishable from its matched Whisper→LLM cascade (Cohen’s κ=0.93); logit lens analysis shows explicit textual content emerging in intermediate hidden states; and LEACE-based erasure of text concepts drives accuracy in both Ultravox and another tested architecture close to zero, indicating that internal text-like representations are causally required. In contrast, Qwen2-Audio departs from this cascade-like behavior, demonstrating that not all architectures reduce to implicit ASR. Under noisy conditions, speech LLMs often underperform simple cascades, with clean-condition accuracy advantages reversing by up to 7.6% at 0 dB SNR.

Conclusion: Most current speech LLMs are effectively costly implementations of an ASR→LLM pipeline, offering little genuine architectural or functional benefit for tasks solvable from transcripts and often performing worse than cascades under noise. However, the divergence exhibited by Qwen2-Audio suggests that architecture choices can yield non-cascade behavior, so future designs might achieve truly audio-native reasoning rather than implicit transcription.

Abstract: Current speech LLMs largely perform implicit ASR: on tasks solvable from a transcript, they are behaviorally and mechanistically equivalent to simple Whisper$\to$LLM cascades. We show this through matched-backbone testing across four speech LLMs and six tasks, controlling for the LLM backbone for the first time. Ultravox is statistically indistinguishable from its matched cascade ($κ{=}0.93$); logit lens reveals literal text emerging in hidden states; LEACE concept erasure confirms text representations are causally necessary in both architectures tested, collapsing accuracy to near-zero. Qwen2-Audio genuinely diverges, revealing cascade equivalence is architecture-dependent, not universal. For most deployed use cases, current speech LLMs are expensive cascades, and under noise, they are worse ones, with clean-condition advantages reversing by up to 7.6% at 0 dB.

### [39] [Unmasking the Factual-Conceptual Gap in Persian Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17623)
*Alireza Sakhaeirad,Ali Ma'manpoosh,Arshia Hemmat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DivanBench is a Persian NLP benchmark that tests cultural reasoning about superstitions and customs rather than just memorized facts, showing current Persian LLMs are biased, overly agreeable, and weak at applying cultural knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Persian NLP benchmarks have started to address pragmatics and politeness, but they do not clearly separate simple recall of cultural facts from deeper reasoning about implicit, context-dependent social norms. The authors want a benchmark that can reveal whether models actually understand and reason about cultural rules—especially arbitrary superstitions and customs—rather than just regurgitating patterns from training data.

Method: The authors design DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark centered on Persian cultural superstitions and customs, which they characterize as arbitrary, context-sensitive rules not easily captured by straightforward logical deduction. The benchmark consists of 315 questions split across three task types: (1) factual retrieval about cultural rules, (2) paired scenario verification where models must judge which behaviors align or conflict with norms, and (3) situational reasoning tasks requiring applying cultural knowledge in context. They then evaluate seven different Persian large language models on these tasks to probe their behavior and reasoning patterns.

Result: Across the seven Persian LLMs, the study finds three main issues: (1) strong acquiescence bias—models often label both norm-following and norm-violating behaviors as acceptable, failing to reject obvious violations; (2) additional continuous pretraining on Persian data increases this bias instead of improving reasoning, and can even harm the ability to recognize contradictions; and (3) there is a consistent 21% performance gap between tasks that require simple factual retrieval and those that require applying that knowledge in realistic scenarios, revealing a weakness in cultural reasoning.

Conclusion: The work concludes that true cultural competence in Persian LLMs cannot be achieved merely by scaling up monolingual Persian pretraining data. Current models tend to imitate surface cultural patterns without forming robust internal schemas of norms and constraints, as evidenced by their acquiescence bias and difficulty rejecting norm violations. DivanBench is proposed as a tool for diagnosing these shortcomings and motivating methods that target genuine cultural reasoning rather than memorization.

Abstract: While emerging Persian NLP benchmarks have expanded into pragmatics and politeness, they rarely distinguish between memorized cultural facts and the ability to reason about implicit social norms. We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas.

### [40] [Differences in Typological Alignment in Language Models' Treatment of Differential Argument Marking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17653)
*Iskar Deng,Nathalia Xu,Shane Steinert-Threlkeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tests whether language models trained on synthetic data develop human-like patterns in differential argument marking (DAM) and finds partial alignment: models match human preferences for which arguments get marked as “special,” but fail to match humans’ strong tendency to mark objects rather than subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work showed that language models trained on artificial languages can spontaneously mirror human-like typological patterns, especially in syntax (e.g., word order universals). It is unknown whether this extends to more abstract semantic and morphological systems like differential argument marking, where case-marking depends on semantic factors (e.g., animacy, definiteness). DAM exhibits robust cross-linguistic tendencies: overt marking usually targets semantically atypical arguments and overwhelmingly marks objects rather than subjects. The authors want to test whether such typological biases can emerge from distributional learning alone in large LMs, and to disentangle which typological dimensions are more likely to be learned.

Method: The authors construct 18 synthetic training corpora, each implementing a different DAM system that varies along two typological dimensions: (1) the direction of markedness (whether overt morphology is assigned to semantically atypical vs typical arguments) and (2) which grammatical function is preferentially marked (objects vs subjects). Using a controlled synthetic learning paradigm, they train separate GPT-2 models on each artificial corpus so that every model learns a distinct DAM system from scratch. After training, they probe the models’ generalization through minimal pair tests that compare the probabilities assigned to sentences differing only in DAM marking patterns, allowing them to infer the models’ typological preferences without contamination from real-language data.

Result: Across the trained models, a consistent bias emerges for natural markedness direction: the models systematically prefer systems where overt marking is reserved for semantically atypical arguments (e.g., unexpected animacy or definiteness configurations), paralleling a robust cross-linguistic universal. However, in contrast to human languages—which show a strong tendency for DAM to target objects—the GPT-2 models do not show a similarly strong object preference. Their preferences for whether subjects or objects get overt marking are weak or inconsistent relative to the human typological skew. This yields a clear empirical dissociation: models mirror human tendencies in one DAM dimension (semantic markedness) but not the other (grammatical function preference).

Conclusion: The partial alignment between model behavior and human typology suggests that some DAM universals (like marking semantically atypical arguments) may arise from general-purpose distributional or efficiency pressures that large LMs can capture, while others (like the strong cross-linguistic bias to mark objects rather than subjects) likely depend on additional cognitive, communicative, or diachronic factors not present in the synthetic training setup. The dissociation implies that typological tendencies are not monolithic: different dimensions of the same phenomenon can have distinct underlying causes. Synthetic-language training of LMs thus provides a useful but limited tool for probing the sources of cross-linguistic regularities, highlighting where distributional learning suffices and where it does not.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained on synthetic corpora can exhibit typological preferences that resemble cross-linguistic regularities in human languages, particularly for syntactic phenomena such as word order. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources.

### [41] [What Language is This? Ask Your Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17655)
*Clara Meister,Ahmetcan Yavuz,Pietro Lesci,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces UniLID, a simple, efficient language identification method built on UnigramLM tokenization that excels especially for low-resource and closely related languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LID systems perform well on high-resource languages but are brittle for low-resource and closely related languages, limiting robust corpus curation, training data analysis, and evaluation for multilingual NLP and large language models.

Method: Proposes UniLID, which learns language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary while treating token segmentation as language-specific. It leverages the probabilistic UnigramLM tokenization framework, with efficient parameter estimation and inference, supports incremental language addition without retraining, and integrates naturally with existing tokenization pipelines.

Result: On standard benchmarks UniLID is competitive with fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3; it substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings (over 70% accuracy with only five labeled samples per language) and yields large performance gains on fine-grained dialect identification tasks.

Conclusion: UniLID offers a data- and compute-efficient, extensible LID solution that addresses weaknesses of existing systems for low-resource and closely related languages, while remaining easy to integrate into current language model tokenization infrastructures.

Abstract: Language Identification (LID) is an important component of many multilingual natural language processing pipelines, where it facilitates corpus curation, training data analysis, and cross-lingual evaluation of large language models. Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.

### [42] [Sink-Aware Pruning for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17664)
*Aidar Myrzakhan,Tianyi Li,Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sink-Aware Pruning, a method to efficiently prune diffusion language models by identifying and removing unstable attention sink tokens, achieving better quality-efficiency trade-offs without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models require expensive iterative denoising at inference time, making them computationally intensive. Existing pruning methods are largely ported from autoregressive LLMs and assume that attention sink tokens should be preserved as global anchors, an assumption that may not hold for diffusion models. There is a need for pruning strategies tailored specifically to the dynamics of diffusion language models to reduce compute while maintaining output quality.

Method: The authors first empirically analyze attention behavior in diffusion language models and show that, unlike in autoregressive models, the positions of attention sinks vary significantly across timesteps, indicating that sinks are transient and not structurally critical. Building on this, they propose Sink-Aware Pruning, an automatic procedure that monitors attention patterns over the generation trajectory, identifies sink positions with high variance or instability, and selectively prunes these unstable sinks during inference. The method is applied without any retraining of the underlying model and is compared against existing pruning heuristics that typically keep sink tokens.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Sink-Aware Pruning yields a superior trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency compared with strong prior pruning baselines. Under matched compute budgets, the proposed method achieves better performance metrics, showing that pruning unstable sinks in diffusion language models is more effective than directly adopting autoregressive pruning heuristics that retain sinks.

Conclusion: Attention sink behavior in diffusion language models differs fundamentally from that in autoregressive models; sinks are transient rather than stable anchors. Recognizing this, Sink-Aware Pruning effectively identifies and removes unstable sink tokens, improving inference efficiency without retraining and outperforming existing pruning approaches. This suggests that pruning strategies must be adapted to the specific dynamics of diffusion-based architectures rather than directly transferred from autoregressive LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\bf \texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute. Our code is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Sink-Aware-Pruning.

### [43] [AIdentifyAGE Ontology for Decision Support in Forensic Dental Age Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16714)
*Renato Marcelo,Ana Rodrigues,Cristiana Palmela Pereira,António Figueiras,Rui Santos,José Rui Figueira,Alexandre P Francisco,Cátia Vaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents AIdentifyAGE, a domain-specific ontology that standardizes and links all elements of forensic dental age assessment, including AI-based methods, to improve transparency, consistency, and interoperability in medico-legal and judicial workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forensic and judicial systems often need accurate age estimation for undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors because legal rights, protections, and procedures depend on age thresholds. Dental age assessment is a key method, but existing practices suffer from heterogeneous methodologies, inconsistent and fragmented data representation, and poor interoperability across clinical, forensic, and legal systems. With the rising use of AI-based approaches, these issues make assessments less transparent, less reproducible, and harder to explain or audit. A structured, shared semantic framework is needed to represent data, methods, and workflows in a consistent and interoperable way.

Method: The authors design and develop a domain-specific ontology named AIdentifyAGE that formally models the full medico-legal workflow of forensic dental age assessment. The ontology covers manual and AI-assisted workflows and provides standardized concepts and relationships for judicial context, subject-level information, forensic examination data, radiographic imaging, dental developmental assessment methods, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation techniques. It is built collaboratively with domain experts and aligned with established upper-level biomedical, dental, and machine-learning ontologies, following FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles to ensure interoperability and extensibility.

Result: The main result is the creation of the AIdentifyAGE ontology itself: a coherent semantic framework that integrates legal, clinical, forensic, and AI-related components of dental age assessment. It enables traceable links between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes, and offers a unified representation of both traditional and AI-based age estimation workflows. By leveraging existing ontologies and FAIR principles, AIdentifyAGE supports interoperability between different information systems and paves the way for ontology-driven tools and decision-support systems.

Conclusion: AIdentifyAGE provides a foundational ontology for forensic dental age assessment, addressing current problems of heterogeneity, fragmentation, and limited interoperability. By modeling the entire medico-legal workflow and connecting manual and AI-based methods within a single semantic framework, it enhances consistency, transparency, and explainability of age estimation processes. This ontology establishes a robust basis for developing future ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial settings, ultimately supporting more reliable and accountable age-related decisions.

Abstract: Age assessment is crucial in forensic and judicial decision-making, particularly in cases involving undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors, where legal thresholds determine access to protection, healthcare, and judicial procedures. Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.

### [44] [Contextuality from Single-State Representations: An Information-Theoretic Principle for Adaptive Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16716)
*Song-Ju Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that when a single internal state space is reused across multiple contexts in adaptive systems, contextuality inevitably emerges and carries an irreducible information-theoretic cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many adaptive systems (biological and artificial) must operate in different contexts but are constrained to reuse the same internal state space due to limited memory or resources. While such single-state reuse is common, its deep representational implications—particularly regarding contextuality—are not well understood. The authors aim to clarify whether contextuality is uniquely quantum or a more general feature of classical probabilistic models under these constraints, and what costs it imposes on representation and learning.

Method: The authors construct a formal, classical probabilistic framework in which different contexts are modeled as interventions acting on a shared internal state space. Within this framework, they derive general theorems showing that any classical model reproducing contextual statistics must rely on more than just the internal state to encode contextual information. They then build a minimal constructive example to demonstrate this information-theoretic cost concretely and explain it operationally. Finally, they analyze how nonclassical probabilistic theories bypass this constraint by dropping the assumption of a single global joint probability space, all without appealing to quantum-specific mathematical structures.

Result: They prove that contextuality emerges inevitably in classical probabilistic models that reuse a single internal state space across contexts, and that capturing contextual outcome statistics imposes an irreducible information-theoretic cost. Specifically, it is impossible for all context dependence to be mediated only through a fixed internal state: additional context-specific information channels or structures are required. The minimal example they provide explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies how it manifests in practice. They also show that nonclassical probabilistic frameworks evade this obstruction by allowing multiple incompatible probability spaces instead of one global joint distribution.

Conclusion: Contextuality is identified as a generic representational constraint for adaptive intelligence, not a peculiar feature exclusive to quantum mechanics. Any system—classical, biological, or artificial—that reuses a single internal state space across multiple contexts must pay an unavoidable information-theoretic price to represent contextual information. Nonclassical probabilistic models avoid this cost by relaxing the requirement of a single global joint probability space. Thus, contextuality should be viewed as a fundamental limitation and design consideration for context-sensitive intelligent systems, independent of their physical substrate.

Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.

### [45] [Mobility-Aware Cache Framework for Scalable LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16727)
*Hua Yan,Heng Tan,Yingxue Zhang,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MobCache is a mobility-aware cache framework that uses latent-space reasoning and lightweight decoding to make large-scale human mobility simulations with LLM agents much more efficient while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based human mobility simulations can capture rich, realistic behaviors but are computationally expensive and hard to scale to city- or nation-level populations. There is a need for a method that keeps the fidelity of LLM-based structured reasoning while greatly reducing cost and enabling reuse of common reasoning patterns in mobility tasks.

Method: The paper introduces MobCache, a framework with two main components. (1) A reasoning component that encodes each intermediate reasoning step into a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to decide when existing embeddings can be reused or recombined instead of invoking a full LLM call. (2) A decoding component that uses a lightweight decoder, trained via mobility law-constrained distillation, to convert latent reasoning chains back into natural language descriptions of agents’ actions. The distillation ensures the decoded behaviors obey domain-specific mobility laws and patterns. Together, these components act as a reconstructible cache over reasoning steps, reducing calls to heavy LLMs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MobCache achieves substantial efficiency gains (e.g., fewer LLM calls, reduced latency and computation) in large-scale human mobility simulations while producing behaviors whose quality and realism are on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines. The framework scales better than prior methods without significantly sacrificing performance metrics.

Conclusion: MobCache shows that caching and reusing LLM reasoning at the latent level, combined with a compact decoder trained under mobility constraints, can maintain high-fidelity human mobility simulations with markedly improved efficiency. This suggests a promising direction for scaling LLM-based agent simulations in urban and transportation domains by focusing on reconstructible latent reasoning rather than repeated full LLM inference.

Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies why AI benchmarks, especially for large language models (LLMs), quickly become saturated and lose their ability to distinguish top models, and identifies benchmark design choices that make them more durable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI benchmarks guide model development and deployment, but many quickly reach saturation, where top models all score near the ceiling. This reduces their usefulness for tracking progress and comparing strong models. The authors want to systematically understand which benchmark properties cause faster saturation so that future benchmarks can be designed to stay informative longer.

Method: The authors collect 60 LLM benchmarks from technical reports of major model developers and annotate each benchmark with 14 properties covering task design (e.g., type of skill tested, difficulty), data construction (e.g., expert-curated vs. crowdsourced, public vs. private test sets), and evaluation format (e.g., multiple-choice vs. free-form responses). They define and measure saturation over time for each benchmark and test five explicit hypotheses relating specific properties to saturation rates through comparative and statistical analyses.

Result: Roughly half of the 60 LLM benchmarks are already saturated, and the likelihood of saturation increases with the age of the benchmark. Contrary to common assumptions, keeping test data private (hidden) does not slow saturation compared to public benchmarks. In contrast, benchmarks created or curated by experts show more resistance to saturation than those built via crowdsourcing. Other benchmark properties also correlate with how quickly saturation occurs.

Conclusion: Benchmark saturation is widespread and worsens over time for LLM evaluation. Design choices significantly affect benchmark longevity: expert curation helps benchmarks remain discriminative, whereas test set secrecy alone does not. The study offers evidence-based guidance on which task, data, and evaluation design decisions can improve the durability and long-term value of future AI benchmarks.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks play a central role in measuring progress in model development and guiding deployment decisions. However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Our findings highlight which design choices extend benchmark longevity and inform strategies for more durable evaluation.

### [47] [Simple Baselines are Competitive with Code Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16805)
*Yonatan Gideoni,Sebastian Risi,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates simple baseline methods for code evolution and finds they often match or outperform sophisticated pipelines across three domains, highlighting that search space design and evaluation methods matter more than complex evolution algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many recent works propose complex code evolution pipelines using large language models, but they are rarely compared against simple, strong baselines. It is unclear whether the gains they report are due to the complexity of the pipelines or other factors like search space design, prompting, and evaluation procedures. The authors aim to rigorously test how much benefit code evolution machinery actually provides over simpler alternatives.

Method: The authors construct and test two simple baseline approaches and compare them against more sophisticated code evolution methods across three domains: (1) searching for improved mathematical bounds, (2) designing agentic scaffolds, and (3) solving machine learning competition tasks. They analyze performance differences and investigate the contributing factors, such as search space design, prompt domain knowledge, and evaluation stochasticity. For scaffold design, they study how variance in scaffold performance and small datasets affect selection and propose alternative evaluation protocols that reduce randomness while remaining economically viable.

Result: Across all three domains, the simple baselines perform on par with or better than the more sophisticated code evolution pipelines. In the mathematical bounds setting, performance is largely determined by the quality of the search space and embedded domain knowledge rather than the specific evolution algorithm. In scaffold design, high variance and limited evaluation data cause the selection of suboptimal scaffolds, leading to simple, hand-designed majority-vote scaffolds outperforming automatically evolved ones. Similar trends are observed in machine learning competition tasks, where complex pipelines do not consistently beat the baselines.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of code evolution systems is often over-attributed to their algorithmic complexity; in practice, the key determinants of success are search space design, domain expertise encoded in prompts, and robust, low-variance evaluation. The authors argue that future work should focus on principled search space construction, stronger baseline comparisons, and improved evaluation methodologies to make claims about code evolution more rigorous and reliable, and they outline best practices and directions for such work.

Abstract: Code evolution is a family of techniques that rely on large language models to search through possible computer programs by evolving or mutating existing code. Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.

### [48] [Improved Upper Bounds for Slicing the Hypercube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16807)
*Duncan Soiffer,Nathaniel Itty,Christopher D. Rosin,Blake Bruell,Mason DiCicco,Gábor N. Sárközy,Ryan Offstein,Daniel Reichman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how many hyperplanes are needed so that every edge of an n-dimensional hypercube is intersected in its interior, improving known upper bounds and giving related partial results for fewer hyperplanes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and optimize the minimal number of hyperplanes required to intersect ("slice") all edges of a high-dimensional hypercube, a problem in discrete geometry and combinatorics, and improve on a decades-old bound from 1971 while also exploring what is possible with fewer hyperplanes.

Method: Use explicit geometric/combinatorial constructions of hyperplanes for specific dimensions, generalize them to arbitrary n via dimension-scaling or patterning arguments, and design 8 hyperplanes that slice all edges of Q_10. The search for such constructions is aided by a new automated discovery tool (CPro1) that couples reasoning large language models with hyperparameter-tuned search algorithms.

Result: Proves an improved general upper bound for the slicing number S(n): S(n) ≤ ceil(4n/5), with a slightly weaker bound S(n) ≤ 4n/5 + 1 when n is an odd multiple of 5, thus beating the prior bound S(n) ≤ ceil(5n/6). Also derives new lower bounds on how many edges can be sliced in Q_n using only k < n hyperplanes.

Conclusion: The edge-slicing problem for hypercubes requires fewer hyperplanes than previously thought, with a new general bound essentially of order 4n/5. The explicit construction for Q_10, found using the automated tool CPro1, demonstrates the power of combining reasoning LLMs with search-based methods for discovering new structures in combinatorics and geometry.

Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k<n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.

### [49] [NeuDiff Agent: A Governed AI Workflow for Single-Crystal Neutron Crystallography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16812)
*Zhongcan Xiao,Leyi Zhang,Guannan Zhang,Xiaoping Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuDiff Agent is a governed, tool-using AI workflow that automates the full crystallography data-processing pipeline at a neutron facility, greatly reducing wall time while maintaining rigorous validation and traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: At large-scale neutron and X-ray facilities, the limiting factor in scientific throughput is increasingly the latency and effort of data analysis and reporting rather than data collection itself. For complex structural and magnetic samples, users must perform iterative cycles of data reduction, integration, refinement, and validation, which are time-consuming, require expert intervention, and delay time-to-result. There is a need for AI-driven automation that can safely and reliably execute these workflows at scale while preserving the governance, traceability, and validation standards needed for publication-quality crystallographic results.

Method: The authors design NeuDiff Agent, an AI ‘agentic’ workflow for the TOPAZ instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source. The system uses a large language model as an orchestrator that is restricted to a set of allowlisted scientific software tools for crystallographic processing. The workflow encodes the existing human expert pipeline: starting from instrument data products, the agent performs reduction, integration, structure refinement, and validation to produce a final crystal structure and publication-ready CIF. Safety and reliability are enforced via governance mechanisms: (1) tool use is restricted to approved commands; (2) fail-closed verification gates are placed at key workflow boundaries so the agent cannot proceed if checks fail; and (3) all steps are logged for full provenance, inspection, auditing, and reproducible replay. The performance of NeuDiff Agent is evaluated using a fixed prompt protocol and multiple repeated end-to-end runs, comparing two different LLM backends. They measure wall time, user vs machine time, intervention burden, and how the system behaves and recovers when verification gates trigger.

Result: In benchmark tests on a reference crystallographic case, NeuDiff Agent successfully executes the entire workflow from raw instrument data to a validated, publication-ready CIF. Compared with a fully manual workflow, wall-clock time is reduced from 435 minutes to approximately 86.5±4.7 minutes and 94.4±3.5 minutes depending on the LLM backend, corresponding to a 4.6–5.0× speedup. The resulting CIFs satisfy crystallographic validation standards, exhibiting no checkCIF level A or B alerts, indicating that the automated pipeline does not degrade result quality. The analysis also quantifies low user-intervention requirements and demonstrates that the verification gates effectively control and recover from potential agent errors.

Conclusion: NeuDiff Agent demonstrates that a governed, tool-using LLM agent can reliably automate complex crystallographic workflows at neutron facilities while maintaining the stringent traceability, validation, and publication requirements of the field. By combining allowlisted tools, fail-closed verification gates, and comprehensive provenance capture, the system achieves substantial reductions in analysis wall time without sacrificing data quality or validation rigor. This work provides a concrete, practical template for deploying agentic AI in facility-based crystallography and suggests a broader pathway for safe, auditable AI automation in other scientific data-analysis pipelines.

Abstract: Large-scale facilities increasingly face analysis and reporting latency as the limiting step in scientific throughput, particularly for structurally and magnetically complex samples that require iterative reduction, integration, refinement, and validation. To improve time-to-result and analysis efficiency, NeuDiff Agent is introduced as a governed, tool-using AI workflow for TOPAZ at the Spallation Neutron Source that takes instrument data products through reduction, integration, refinement, and validation to a validated crystal structure and a publication-ready CIF. NeuDiff Agent executes this established pipeline under explicit governance by restricting actions to allowlisted tools, enforcing fail-closed verification gates at key workflow boundaries, and capturing complete provenance for inspection, auditing, and controlled replay. Performance is assessed using a fixed prompt protocol and repeated end-to-end runs with two large language model backends, with user and machine time partitioned and intervention burden and recovery behaviors quantified under gating. In a reference-case benchmark, NeuDiff Agent reduces wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5(4.7) to 94.4(3.5) minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing a validated CIF with no checkCIF level A or B alerts. These results establish a practical route to deploy agentic AI in facility crystallography while preserving traceability and publication-facing validation requirements.

### [50] [Node Learning: A Framework for Adaptive, Decentralised and Collaborative Network Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16814)
*Eiman Kanjo,Mustafa Aslanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Node Learning is a decentralized edge AI paradigm where each node learns locally and shares knowledge opportunistically instead of relying on centralized aggregation or strict synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AI architectures struggle at the edge due to high data transmission costs, latency, energy use, and reliance on large data centers, which do not scale well in heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. A new paradigm is needed to make AI more scalable, robust, and adaptable in such settings.

Method: The paper conceptually defines a new paradigm called Node Learning, where individual edge nodes continuously learn from local data, keep their own model states, and selectively interact with peers to exchange learned knowledge when it is beneficial. Learning spreads through overlapping interactions and diffusion among nodes, rather than global synchronization or central aggregation. The paper contrasts Node Learning with existing decentralized approaches and explores its implications for communication, hardware, trust, and governance.

Result: As a concept paper, it does not present empirical results but instead offers a structured framework and abstraction for decentralized intelligence at the edge, clarifying how Node Learning can unify autonomous and cooperative behavior while tolerating heterogeneity across data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity.

Conclusion: Node Learning provides a broader decentralized perspective that subsumes existing paradigms, situating them within a framework where intelligence is distributed across edge nodes that learn locally and collaborate opportunistically. This approach promises better scalability, robustness, and flexibility for AI at the edge, without discarding current methods but reinterpreting them within this new abstraction.

Abstract: The expansion of AI toward the edge increasingly exposes the cost and fragility of cen- tralised intelligence. Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective

### [51] [An order-oriented approach to scoring hesitant fuzzy elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16827)
*Luis Merino,Gabriel Navarro,Carlos Salvatierra,Evangelina Santos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper builds an order-theoretic foundation for scoring and ranking hesitant fuzzy elements, identifies problems with existing orders, and proposes new score and dominance functions that satisfy strong normative properties and are applicable to group decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scoring approaches for hesitant fuzzy sets are widely used but often lack a rigorous grounding in order theory, which can lead to inconsistencies and misleading rankings. Moreover, classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements have been assumed to form lattice structures, a property useful for aggregation and reasoning, but this assumption had not been critically examined. There is also a practical need for ranking mechanisms that incorporate minimum acceptability thresholds to better support decision-making and preference modeling in uncertain environments.

Method: The authors adopt an order-oriented framework where each scoring function for hesitant fuzzy elements is explicitly tied to a specific underlying order on nonempty subsets of [0,1]. They systematically analyze several classical orders used on hesitant fuzzy elements and prove that these orders do not generate lattice structures, contradicting previous claims. They then focus on the symmetric order, defining scores with respect to it and verifying that these scores meet established normative criteria, such as strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition. Building on this, they introduce a new parametric class of ranking tools, called dominance functions, defined relative to control sets that encode minimum acceptability levels. They instantiate this class by giving two concrete dominance functions for finite hesitant fuzzy sets—the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function—and show how these can be used to construct fuzzy preference relations in group decision-making contexts.

Result: The paper demonstrates that several well-known orders on hesitant fuzzy elements do not induce lattice structures, invalidating prior assumptions in the literature. It establishes that scores derived from the symmetric order satisfy important normative properties for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity under unions and the Gärdenfors condition. Furthermore, it defines the concept of dominance functions and provides two explicit examples (discrete and relative dominance) for finite hesitant fuzzy sets, proving that these functions can be used to create meaningful ranking and fuzzy preference relations that respect minimum acceptability thresholds and can be applied to group decision-making problems.

Conclusion: The study offers a unified, order-based foundation for scoring and ranking hesitant fuzzy elements, clarifies structural misconceptions about classical orders, and highlights the advantages of using symmetric-order-based scores. By introducing dominance functions and demonstrating their applicability, the paper equips researchers and practitioners with more robust and normatively sound tools for preference modeling and group decision-making under hesitancy. This framework can serve as a basis for further theoretical work on hesitant fuzzy orders and for practical decision-support systems that need consistent and interpretable ranking mechanisms.

Abstract: Traditional scoring approaches on hesitant fuzzy sets often lack a formal base in order theory. This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.
  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.

*Haiyang Xu,Xi Zhang,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Zhaozai Zhu,Shengjie Zhou,Xuhao Hu,Feiyu Gao,Junjie Cao,Zihua Wang,Zhiyuan Chen,Jitong Liao,Qi Zheng,Jiahui Zeng,Ze Xu,Shuai Bai,Junyang Lin,Jingren Zhou,Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Owl-1.5 is an open-source family of multi-size GUI agent models that achieve state-of-the-art performance across many GUI automation, grounding, tool-calling, and memory/knowledge benchmarks via improved data generation, unified reasoning enhancement, and a new multi-platform RL algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent models struggle with reliable cross-platform GUI control, long-horizon tasks, and efficient data collection/training. There is a need for a unified, open-source GUI agent that works across desktop, mobile, and web, supports real-time interaction and cloud-edge collaboration, and achieves strong performance on diverse benchmarks (automation, grounding, tools, memory).

Method: The authors build GUI-Owl-1.5, a family of instruct and thinking models of varying sizes (2B–235B) deployable on multiple platforms. They design: (1) a Hybrid Data Flywheel combining simulated and cloud-based sandbox environments to collect high-quality UI understanding and interaction trajectories; (2) a unified thought-synthesis pipeline to enhance reasoning and agent skills like tool/MCP usage, memory, and multi-agent adaptation; (3) MRPO, a new multi-platform environment RL algorithm to handle conflicts across platforms and improve training efficiency for long-horizon tasks. They evaluate on >20 GUI benchmarks covering automation, grounding, tool-calling, and memory/knowledge tasks.

Result: GUI-Owl-1.5 reaches state-of-the-art results among open-source models on over 20 GUI benchmarks: 56.5 (OSWorld), 71.6 (AndroidWorld), 48.4 (WebArena) for automation; 80.3 on ScreenSpotPro for grounding; 47.6 on OSWorld-MCP and 46.8 on MobileWorld for tool calling; and 75.5 on GUI-Knowledge Bench for memory/knowledge tasks. Models are released in multiple sizes and platforms, with an online cloud-sandbox demo.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl-1.5 demonstrates that combining a hybrid data-generation pipeline, unified reasoning/agent-capability enhancement, and a specialized multi-platform RL algorithm can produce scalable GUI agents that generalize across platforms and tasks and set new open-source benchmarks. The work provides both models and infrastructure (demo and code) to advance research and practical deployment of GUI agents on edge and cloud devices.

Abstract: The paper introduces GUI-Owl-1.5, the latest native GUI agent model that features instruct/thinking variants in multiple sizes (2B/4B/8B/32B/235B) and supports a range of platforms (desktop, mobile, browser, and more) to enable cloud-edge collaboration and real-time interaction. GUI-Owl-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results on more than 20+ GUI benchmarks on open-source models: (1) on GUI automation tasks, it obtains 56.5 on OSWorld, 71.6 on AndroidWorld, and 48.4 on WebArena; (2) on grounding tasks, it obtains 80.3 on ScreenSpotPro; (3) on tool-calling tasks, it obtains 47.6 on OSWorld-MCP, and 46.8 on MobileWorld; (4) on memory and knowledge tasks, it obtains 75.5 on GUI-Knowledge Bench. GUI-Owl-1.5 incorporates several key innovations: (1) Hybird Data Flywheel: we construct the data pipeline for UI understanding and trajectory generation based on a combination of simulated environments and cloud-based sandbox environments, in order to improve the efficiency and quality of data collection. (2) Unified Enhancement of Agent Capabilities: we use a unified thought-synthesis pipeline to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, while placing particular emphasis on improving key agent abilities, including Tool/MCP use, memory and multi-agent adaptation; (3) Multi-platform Environment RL Scaling: We propose a new environment RL algorithm, MRPO, to address the challenges of multi-platform conflicts and the low training efficiency of long-horizon tasks. The GUI-Owl-1.5 models are open-sourced, and an online cloud-sandbox demo is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

### [53] [OpenSage: Self-programming Agent Generation Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16891)
*Hongwei Li,Zhun Wang,Qinrun Dai,Yuzhou Nie,Jinjun Peng,Ruitong Liu,Jingyang Zhang,Kaijie Zhu,Jingxuan He,Lun Wang,Yangruibo Ding,Yueqi Chen,Wenbo Guo,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenSage is an agent development kit that lets LLMs automatically design their own agent topology, tools, and memory, outperforming existing ADKs on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent development kits either lack key functionalities or depend heavily on humans to manually specify agent topology, tools, and memory. This manual, human-centered design limits scalability, generalizability, and performance of LLM-based agents, especially in complex tasks like software engineering. The authors want a system where LLMs themselves can configure and manage these components more autonomously.

Method: They design OpenSage, an ADK that (1) lets LLMs autonomously create agents and sub-agents with self-generated topologies and toolsets, (2) provides comprehensive, structured support for tools and agent management, and (3) introduces a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient storage and retrieval. The framework also includes a specialized toolkit focused on software engineering tasks. They then evaluate OpenSage against existing ADKs on three state-of-the-art benchmarks using various backbone LLMs, and run ablation studies to isolate the contributions of major components (topology, tools, memory).

Result: Across three advanced benchmarks and multiple backbone models, OpenSage consistently outperforms existing ADKs. The experiments show improved agent performance when using OpenSage’s automatic topology and tool creation and its structured memory. Ablation studies confirm that each key design element—self-generated topology, tool management, and hierarchical graph memory—contributes significantly to the overall performance gains.

Conclusion: OpenSage demonstrates that shifting from human-designed to AI-designed agent structures, tools, and memory yields better-performing agents. Its autonomous agent creation capabilities, graph-based memory, and specialized software engineering toolkit form an effective, generalizable ADK. The authors suggest this marks a move toward AI-centered paradigms in agent development, where LLMs take primary responsibility for designing and managing their own agent ecosystems.

Abstract: Agent development kits (ADKs) provide effective platforms and tooling for constructing agents, and their designs are critical to the constructed agents' performance, especially the functionality for agent topology, tools, and memory. However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.

### [54] [AgentLAB: Benchmarking LLM Agents against Long-Horizon Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16901)
*Tanqiu Jiang,Yuhui Wang,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentLAB, a benchmark for testing how vulnerable LLM-based agents are to complex, multi-step (long-horizon) attacks in realistic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents are now used in complex, multi-step tasks and environments, which exposes them to new security risks that do not appear in simple, single-turn interactions. Existing evaluations and defenses largely focus on single-turn prompts, so they miss threats that unfold gradually over many steps via interactions with users and tools. There is no systematic way to measure how susceptible LLM agents are to these long-horizon, adaptive attacks, making it hard to understand and improve their security in realistic deployments.

Method: The authors build AgentLAB, a benchmark suite specifically for evaluating long-horizon security vulnerabilities in LLM agents. AgentLAB includes five new attack categories—intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning—implemented across 28 realistic environments that emulate practical agent use cases. In total, they design 644 test cases that probe whether agents can be manipulated over multi-turn interactions involving users, tools, and environment state. They then run representative LLM agents and existing defense mechanisms within these scenarios and measure how often attacks succeed and whether defenses mitigate them.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that current LLM agents are highly vulnerable to long-horizon, adaptive attacks across the proposed scenarios. Furthermore, defenses that work reasonably well in single-turn or static prompt settings do not reliably protect agents when attacks unfold over many turns and involve tools or memory. Overall, the benchmark reveals large, previously under-measured security gaps in current agentic systems.

Conclusion: AgentLAB provides the first dedicated benchmark for systematically assessing long-horizon security risks in LLM agents. The findings indicate that today’s agents and existing single-turn defenses are inadequate against multi-step, adaptive attacks. The authors propose AgentLAB as a public resource for the community to track progress and drive the development of more robust, long-horizon-aware defenses for LLM agents in realistic, tool-using environments.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed in long-horizon, complex environments to solve challenging problems, but this expansion exposes them to long-horizon attacks that exploit multi-turn user-agent-environment interactions to achieve objectives infeasible in single-turn settings. To measure agent vulnerabilities to such risks, we present AgentLAB, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating LLM agent susceptibility to adaptive, long-horizon attacks. Currently, AgentLAB supports five novel attack types including intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning, spanning 28 realistic agentic environments, and 644 security test cases. Leveraging AgentLAB, we evaluate representative LLM agents and find that they remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks; moreover, defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate long-horizon threats. We anticipate that AgentLAB will serve as a valuable benchmark for tracking progress on securing LLM agents in practical settings. The benchmark is publicly available at https://tanqiujiang.github.io/AgentLAB_main.

### [55] [LLM-WikiRace: Benchmarking Long-term Planning and Reasoning over Real-World Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16902)
*Juliusz Ziomek,William Bankes,Lorenz Wolf,Shyam Sundhar Ramesh,Xiaohang Tang,Ilija Bogunovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Wikirace is a benchmark where LLMs must navigate Wikipedia links to reach a target page, revealing strengths and weaknesses in planning, reasoning, and world knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks insufficiently isolate and test long-horizon planning, stepwise reasoning, and practical world-knowledge integration. The authors want a simple, controlled task that stresses these abilities simultaneously and exposes the gap between current LLM performance and robust planning behavior.

Method: The authors design LLM-Wikirace, a task where models start from a source Wikipedia page and must reach a specific target page by selecting hyperlink hops step by step. The benchmark includes different difficulty levels (easy and hard). They evaluate a wide range of open- and closed-source LLMs, measuring success rates, path efficiency, and behavior such as looping and recovery after failures. They also perform trajectory-level analyses to disentangle the roles of world knowledge versus planning and long-horizon reasoning in task success.

Result: State-of-the-art closed models like Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5 achieve superhuman performance on easy tasks but experience a sharp drop on hard tasks, with Gemini-3 succeeding in only 23% of hard games. Analysis shows that world knowledge strongly influences performance up to a certain difficulty, beyond which planning and long-horizon reasoning are the main bottlenecks. Models often fail to replan effectively and instead fall into loops.

Conclusion: LLM-Wikirace exposes significant limitations in current LLMs’ planning and long-horizon reasoning despite their strong world knowledge and easy-task performance. The benchmark is simple yet discriminative, providing an open, reproducible setting—and code and leaderboard—for developing and comparing more planning-capable LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove. Our code and leaderboard available at https:/llmwikirace.github.io.

### [56] [Narrow fine-tuning erodes safety alignment in vision-language agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16931)
*Idhant Gulati,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how fine-tuning already-aligned multimodal (vision-language) models on harmful, narrow-domain data can severely degrade their safety alignment, in ways that generalize across tasks and modalities, and investigates partial mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lifelong multimodal agents, which must keep learning after deployment, need to acquire new capabilities without losing their safety alignment. However, post-training on new data—especially narrow, potentially harmful domains—may introduce misalignment. Existing safety evaluations are mostly unimodal and may underestimate issues in vision-language models. The authors want to understand how harmful fine-tuning affects alignment, how this misalignment manifests geometrically in representation space, and whether simple mitigation strategies can prevent or reverse it.

Method: The authors fine-tune an aligned vision-language model (Gemma3-4B) on narrow-domain harmful datasets using LoRA adapters with varying ranks to control adaptation capacity. They evaluate misalignment using both text-only and multimodal safety benchmarks and compare the severity of emergent harmful behaviors across settings. They also vary the proportion of harmful data in the training mix to study sensitivity. To understand the structure of misalignment, they perform geometric analysis (e.g., PCA) on model activations to identify low-dimensional subspaces associated with harmful behaviors. Finally, they test two mitigation strategies: (1) benign narrow fine-tuning and (2) activation-based steering, measuring how much each reduces misalignment while checking for residual harmful behavior.

Result: Fine-tuning on narrow-domain harmful data induces strong emergent misalignment that generalizes to other tasks and modalities. Misalignment grows monotonically with LoRA rank, indicating that higher adaptation capacity allows more harmful behavior to be encoded. Multimodal evaluations detect significantly higher misalignment (about 70.71 ± 1.22 at rank 128) compared with text-only measures (about 41.19 ± 2.51), implying that unimodal benchmarks underestimate safety degradation in vision-language models. Even small fractions of harmful data (as low as 10% of the training mixture) cause substantial alignment loss. Geometric analysis finds that harmful behavior is concentrated in a low-dimensional subspace, with most misalignment variance captured by about 10 principal components. Mitigation attempts via benign narrow fine-tuning and activation steering substantially reduce but do not fully eliminate harmful behaviors.

Conclusion: Post-deployment fine-tuning of multimodal models on harmful or mixed-domain data can cause significant, broadly generalizing misalignment, and this effect grows with the expressive capacity of the adaptation method. Safety degradation is worse than what text-only evaluations suggest, highlighting the insufficiency of unimodal benchmarks for vision-language systems. Harmful behaviors appear to be encoded in a compact, low-dimensional subspace, which is promising for interpretability and control, but current mitigation methods—benign fine-tuning and activation steering—cannot fully remove the learned misalignment. The work argues for developing more robust continual learning and post-training frameworks that can preserve safety alignment as models are updated after deployment.

Abstract: Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment. We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.

### [57] [DeepContext: Stateful Real-Time Detection of Multi-Turn Adversarial Intent Drift in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16935)
*Justin Albrethsen,Yash Datta,Kunal Kumar,Sharath Rajasekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeepContext, a stateful safety framework that tracks user intent over multi-turn LLM conversations to better detect jailbreaks, outperforming existing stateless guardrails with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety systems are mostly stateless, analyzing each user query independently. This makes them vulnerable to multi-turn adversarial strategies (e.g., Crescendo, ActorAttack) where malicious intent is slowly revealed across turns. There is a need for safety mechanisms that model the temporal evolution of user intent across a whole dialogue without incurring prohibitive computational cost.

Method: DeepContext introduces a stateful monitoring framework based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It first derives fine-tuned embeddings for each turn in a conversation, then feeds the sequence of these embeddings into an RNN that maintains a hidden state across turns. This hidden state encodes the accumulated risk and evolving intent, enabling the system to detect jailbreak patterns that unfold incrementally rather than in a single query.

Result: In experiments on multi-turn jailbreak detection benchmarks, DeepContext achieves a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84. This substantially surpasses major baselines, including hyperscaler cloud guardrails and open-weight safety models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 and Granite-Guardian, both of which reach only 0.67 F1. The framework also runs with under 20 ms inference overhead on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, showing it is suitable for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: Modeling conversations as sequences and explicitly tracking the temporal evolution of user intent via a recurrent hidden state allows DeepContext to close the "Safety Gap" left by stateless guardrails. The approach yields better jailbreak detection accuracy while remaining computationally efficient, suggesting that lean stateful monitors can be more effective and practical than large, stateless safety models for multi-turn LLM interactions.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have scaled, safety guardrails remain largely stateless, treating multi-turn dialogues as a series of disconnected events. This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a "Safety Gap" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models.

### [58] [SourceBench: Can AI Answers Reference Quality Web Sources?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16942)
*Hexi Jin,Stephen Liu,Yuheng Li,Simran Malik,Yiying Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces SourceBench, a benchmark to evaluate the quality of web sources cited by LLMs, using an eight-metric framework and human-calibrated LLM evaluations across 100 real-world queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs that cite web pages focus mostly on whether the final answer is correct, neglecting the quality and reliability of the underlying sources. As LLMs are increasingly used as web assistants and search front-ends, it is important to systematically measure how good the cited sources are along dimensions like relevance, accuracy, and trustworthiness. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics for evaluating the cited evidence itself across diverse query types.

Method: The authors create SourceBench, a benchmark built from 100 real-world user queries spanning multiple intents (informational, factual, argumentative, social, shopping). For each query, they collect cited web sources from multiple systems and annotate them with an eight-metric evaluation framework covering content quality (relevance, factual accuracy, objectivity) and page-level qualities (such as freshness, authority/accountability, and clarity). They produce a human-labeled dataset and train or calibrate an LLM-based evaluator to score sources, showing that its judgments align closely with expert human labels. They then use SourceBench to systematically evaluate eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools over 3996 cited sources, and conduct additional analyses of the results.

Result: SourceBench provides a validated framework and dataset for assessing cited source quality. The calibrated LLM evaluator matches expert human judgments closely, enabling scalable evaluation. Applying SourceBench to 3996 sources cited by eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools reveals differences in source quality across systems and query types and yields four key empirical insights (not enumerated in the abstract) about how current GenAI and search systems select and present evidence.

Conclusion: Evidence quality of cited web sources is a distinct and critical dimension of LLM and search-system performance that is not captured by answer correctness alone. SourceBench offers a practical benchmark and LLM-based evaluator to study and compare systems on this dimension. The findings highlight current shortcomings and trade-offs in how systems select sources and point to research directions for improving GenAI-integrated web search and citation practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly answer queries by citing web sources, but existing evaluations emphasize answer correctness rather than evidence quality. We introduce SourceBench, a benchmark for measuring the quality of cited web sources across 100 real-world queries spanning informational, factual, argumentative, social, and shopping intents. SourceBench uses an eight-metric framework covering content quality (content relevance, factual accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (e.g., freshness, authority/accountability, clarity), and includes a human-labeled dataset with a calibrated LLM-based evaluator that matches expert judgments closely. We evaluate eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools over 3996 cited sources using SourceBench and conduct further experiments to understand the evaluation results. Overall, our work reveals four key new insights that can guide future research in the direction of GenAI and web search.

### [59] [Mind the GAP: Text Safety Does Not Transfer to Tool-Call Safety in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16943)
*Arnold Cartagena,Ariane Teixeira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper shows that current safety alignment that prevents harmful text does not reliably prevent harmful tool actions by LLM agents, and introduces the GAP benchmark to measure this mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used as agents that can call tools and take real-world actions, existing safety evaluations that focus only on text refusals may miss cases where the model appears safe in text but still performs dangerous actions via tools. The authors want a systematic way to quantify this discrepancy and test whether current alignment methods actually make tool-mediated behavior safe.

Method: The authors design the GAP benchmark, which evaluates six frontier models acting as agents with tool-calling abilities across six regulated domains: pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure. For each domain, they create seven jailbreak scenarios that try to elicit harmful behavior, under three different system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging) and two prompt variants, resulting in 17,420 datapoints. They analyze both the textual responses (whether the model refuses) and the tool calls (whether they attempt harmful actions), define a GAP metric capturing divergence between text safety and tool-call safety, and run statistical comparisons and ablations, including tests of runtime governance contracts that constrain tool outputs.

Result: The evaluation reveals that all six models sometimes refuse harmful requests in text while simultaneously issuing tool calls that execute the requested harmful actions, showing a nontrivial divergence between text safety and tool-call safety as captured by the GAP metric. Even with safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such divergence cases remain across models. System prompts strongly affect tool-call safety, with tool-call safe rates varying by up to 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most sensitive one, and most pairwise ablation comparisons remaining statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts help reduce information leakage from tools but do not measurably reduce the frequency of forbidden tool-call attempts themselves.

Conclusion: Text-level safety refusals are not a reliable proxy for the safety of an LLM agent’s tool-using behavior. Safety-tuned models may still take harmful actions via tools even while appearing compliant in their natural language. Therefore, safety evaluation must explicitly target tool-call behavior, and dedicated methods are needed to measure and mitigate risks arising from agentic tool use rather than relying solely on text-based alignment signals.

Abstract: Large language models deployed as agents increasingly interact with external systems through tool calls--actions with real-world consequences that text outputs alone do not carry. Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.

### [60] [LLM4Cov: Execution-Aware Agentic Learning for High-coverage Testbench Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16953)
*Hejia Zhang,Zhongming Yu,Chia-Tung Ho,Haoxing Ren,Brucek Khailany,Jishen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents LLM4Cov, an offline learning framework for execution-aware LLM agents tailored to hardware verification under expensive, slow execution feedback, achieving strong coverage performance with a compact model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Execution-aware LLM agents could use feedback from tools/simulators to learn better policies, but in domains like high-coverage hardware verification, execution feedback is costly, slow, and non-differentiable, making standard online RL approaches impractical. There is a need for a framework that can learn effective verification agents from limited, expensive execution signals while remaining scalable and competitive with much larger models.

Method: The authors formulate hardware verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators, enabling an offline agent-learning setting. Within this formulation, they introduce: (1) execution-validated data curation, which filters and structures training data using actual execution outcomes; (2) policy-aware agentic data synthesis, where the current policy is used to generate new training trajectories; and (3) worst-state-prioritized sampling, focusing learning on the hardest or least successful states. They also adapt an existing hardware verification suite into a more realistic benchmark via a revised evaluation protocol.

Result: Using their pipeline, they train a relatively small 4B-parameter model that achieves a 69.2% coverage pass rate in an agentic evaluation setting. This model surpasses its larger teacher model by 5.3 percentage points and is competitive with models that are about 10 times larger in parameter count, despite the restricted execution budget.

Conclusion: Offline, execution-aware training with carefully designed data curation, policy-aware synthesis, and difficulty-prioritized sampling can effectively compensate for limited, expensive feedback in hardware verification tasks. LLM4Cov demonstrates that compact models can not only match but exceed the performance of larger teacher models and approach the performance of much larger systems under realistic verification constraints, suggesting a promising direction for scalable verification agents and similar domains with costly execution signals.

Abstract: Execution-aware LLM agents offer a promising paradigm for learning from tool feedback, but such feedback is often expensive and slow to obtain, making online reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.

### [61] [Automating Agent Hijacking via Structural Template Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16958)
*Xinhao Deng,Jiaqing Wu,Miao Chen,Yue Xiao,Ke Xu,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework that exploits structured template injection to manipulate LLM agents by inducing role confusion via chat template tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic LLM systems are vulnerable to agent hijacking, where attackers inject malicious instructions through retrieved or contextual content. Existing prompt-injection attacks are mostly handcrafted, semantics-focused, have low success rates, and transfer poorly to closed-source, black-box commercial LLM agents. There is a need for a systematic, automated, and transferable attack framework that targets core architectural mechanisms of LLM agents to better understand and secure them.

Method: The authors introduce Phantom, which leverages Structured Template Injection. It exploits the fact that LLM agents use specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool messages. By inserting structured templates into retrieved context, Phantom induces role confusion, making the model treat injected content as real user instructions or tool outputs. To make the attack transferable to black-box agents, they design an attack template search framework: (1) multi-level template augmentation grows a diverse set of structured templates; (2) a Template Autoencoder (TAE) maps discrete templates into a continuous latent space; and (3) Bayesian optimization is run in that latent space to find adversarial vectors, which are then decoded into optimized structured templates with high attack success.

Result: Across multiple LLM families and agent setups (Qwen, GPT, Gemini), Phantom achieves substantially higher Attack Success Rate and requires fewer queries compared to existing prompt-injection and agent-hijacking baselines. Applying Phantom to real commercial products, the authors discovered and had confirmed more than 70 distinct vulnerabilities, demonstrating that structured template-based hijacking is both effective and widely exploitable in practice.

Conclusion: Targeting the structural mechanisms of LLM agents—specifically chat templates and role delimiters—is a highly effective strategy for agent hijacking. Automated search in a learned template space, combined with Bayesian optimization, yields attacks that are strong and transferable even against black-box commercial systems. The findings indicate that current agentic architectures are systematically vulnerable to structured template injection and that defenses must consider template-level and role-parsing robustness, not just semantic prompt filtering, to secure next-generation LLM agents.

Abstract: Agent hijacking, highlighted by OWASP as a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, enables adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.

### [62] [HQFS: Hybrid Quantum Classical Financial Security with VQC Forecasting, QUBO Annealing, and Audit-Ready Post-Quantum Signing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16976)
*Srikumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HQFS, a hybrid quantum-classical financial risk system that jointly handles forecasting, discrete portfolio optimization, and cryptographic auditability, leading to better predictive accuracy, portfolio performance, and solve times under realistic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional financial risk systems separate forecasting from optimization: a model predicts returns/risks and a downstream optimizer makes decisions such as portfolio rebalancing. This decoupling can fail in practice when markets shift, when discrete portfolio constraints (lot sizes, caps) are imposed, or when optimization scales to large asset universes, causing instability or slow solutions. Regulated environments also require a strong, verifiable audit trail linking each portfolio decision to the exact model state and inputs, which standard pipelines do not provide. The authors aim to create an integrated, practical pipeline that jointly addresses prediction quality, constrained decision-making, computational efficiency, and end-to-end auditability, while exploring advantages from quantum computing techniques.

Method: HQFS is a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline with three stages. (1) Forecasting: It learns one-step-ahead returns and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) coupled with a small classical head, forming a quantum-enhanced predictive model. (2) Decision/Optimization: It encodes the portfolio risk–return objective and discrete constraints into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation and solves it using quantum annealing hardware when available, while retaining a compatible classical QUBO solver as a deployment fallback. (3) Auditability: Each portfolio rebalance output is cryptographically signed with a post-quantum digital signature scheme so that any allocation can later be verified independently of the runtime environment, providing a tamper-evident audit trail. The full system is evaluated on a market dataset under realistic constraints and compared with tuned classical baselines, including mixed-integer optimization.

Result: On the studied market dataset, HQFS achieves lower prediction errors than a tuned classical baseline, reducing return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1%. At the decision layer, it improves out-of-sample portfolio performance, increasing Sharpe ratio by 9.4% and reducing maximum drawdown by 11.7%. In terms of computational efficiency, the QUBO-based optimization stage cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer programming baseline subject to the same constraints, while still producing allocation decisions that are fully traceable through cryptographic signatures.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that HQFS effectively integrates quantum-enhanced forecasting, QUBO-based discrete portfolio optimization, and post-quantum cryptographic signing into a single, practical workflow for financial risk management. This integrated design yields improvements in predictive accuracy, portfolio risk–return performance, and optimization speed under realistic discrete constraints, while also providing strong, verifiable auditability suitable for regulated settings. The results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical approaches can deliver measurable benefits in real-world financial decision systems, even when classical fallback paths are required for deployment.

Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.

### [63] [Fundamental Limits of Black-Box Safety Evaluation: Information-Theoretic and Computational Barriers from Latent Context Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16984)
*Vishal Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that for certain AI models whose risky behavior is triggered only in hidden, rare contexts, black-box testing cannot reliably estimate real-world deployment risk, and it quantifies how bad this gap can be.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations of AI systems usually rely on black-box testing: we query the model on some test distribution and assume its behavior generalizes to deployment. The authors question this assumption, especially for models that might behave differently in rare but important real-world situations that tests almost never cover. They want to formalize when and why black-box testing can fundamentally fail to detect such hidden unsafe behaviors, even with adaptive testing or significant computational effort.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of latent context-conditioned policies, where model outputs depend on hidden internal variables that may be infrequent in evaluation but common in deployment. They then use tools from statistical decision theory (Le Cam's method, minimax lower bounds), information-theoretic arguments, Yao's minimax principle, and cryptographic assumptions (trapdoor one-way functions) to derive lower bounds on the accuracy of any black-box evaluator. They also analyze white-box probing statistically, deriving sample complexity bounds and bias-correction formulas that depend on a probe quality parameter gamma.

Result: (1) For passive evaluation with i.i.d. samples from the evaluation distribution, they prove that any estimator of deployment risk must incur an expected absolute error of at least about 0.208 * delta * L, where delta is the trigger probability in deployment and L is the loss gap between safe and unsafe behavior. (2) For adaptive evaluation, even allowing fully adaptive querying, they show a worst-case error lower bound of at least delta * L / 16 when the deployment distribution is over a large enough domain, and they show that reliably detecting unsafe behavior requires on the order of 1/epsilon queries. (3) Under standard cryptographic assumptions (trapdoor one-way functions), they construct a computational separation where deployment can exploit privileged trapdoor information to elicit unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator lacking this trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, they derive that estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires on the order of 1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2) samples, and they give an explicit bias-correction method to account for probe error.

Conclusion: Black-box safety evaluation can be fundamentally unreliable for models whose behavior depends on hidden, deployment-specific contexts. There are provable statistical and computational limits on how well any black-box testing procedure can estimate deployment risk, even with adaptive querying and large budgets. Consequently, for worst-case safety guarantees, it is mathematically necessary to supplement black-box tests with additional safeguards such as model architecture constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability tools, or deployment-time monitoring. The paper thereby formalizes when black-box evaluation is insufficient and clarifies what kinds of additional structure or information are required for robust safety assurance.

Abstract: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance. We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.

### [64] [Conv-FinRe: A Conversational and Longitudinal Benchmark for Utility-Grounded Financial Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16990)
*Yan Wang,Yi Han,Lingfei Qian,Yueru He,Xueqing Peng,Dongji Feng,Zhuohan Xie,Vincent Jim Zhang,Rosie Guo,Fengran Mo,Jimin Huang,Yankai Chen,Xue Liu,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose Conv-FinRe, a conversational stock recommendation benchmark that separates imitating user behavior from delivering rational, utility-based financial advice, showing current LLMs trade off decision quality vs behavioral alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation benchmarks mostly test if models can mimic what users did, assuming observed behavior is the ground truth of good decisions. In financial advisory this is problematic: real trades are noisy, myopic, and distorted by market volatility, so simply copying them does not mean providing good advice or helping users reach long-term goals. The authors want a benchmark that evaluates both rational decision quality and behavioral alignment, and that can reveal when models chase user noise or market trends instead of following investor-specific risk preferences.

Method: They construct Conv-FinRe, a benchmark for stock recommendations over a fixed investment horizon. Each instance includes: (1) an onboarding interview to elicit investor profile and risk preferences; (2) step-wise market context; and (3) advisory dialogues. Models must output stock rankings at each step. The benchmark provides multi-view reference signals that separate descriptive behavior (what users actually did) from normative utility (what would be rational given their risk profile and market data). They create the dataset from real market data and human decision trajectories, simulate controlled advisory conversations, and then evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on both behavior matching and utility-based ranking metrics.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows a systematic trade-off: models that achieve high performance on utility-based ranking (i.e., better rational financial decisions) tend to match user historical choices poorly, while models that align closely with user behavior often track short-term noise and perform worse on utility-based criteria. This reveals a persistent tension between optimizing for decision quality and for behavioral imitation in current LLMs.

Conclusion: Conv-FinRe enables finer-grained evaluation of conversational financial advisors by disentangling behavioral imitation from rational, utility-based recommendation quality. The benchmark demonstrates that existing LLMs struggle to jointly optimize both goals and often prioritize either rational analysis or behavioral alignment at the expense of the other. By releasing the dataset and code publicly, the authors aim to spur methods that better reconcile user-centered alignment with sound, risk-aware financial decision-making.

Abstract: Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.

### [65] [Sonar-TS: Search-Then-Verify Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17001)
*Zhao Tan,Yiji Zhao,Shiyu Wang,Chang Xu,Yuxuan Liang,Xiping Liu,Shirui Pan,Ming Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sonar-TS is a neuro-symbolic system for answering natural language queries over very large time-series databases using a two-stage search-and-verify pipeline, evaluated on a new benchmark NLQTSBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-expert users need to query massive time-series databases (TSDBs) in natural language to find events, patterns, anomalies, and summaries. Existing Text-to-SQL approaches are not suited to continuous, morphological patterns like shapes or anomalies, and time-series models cannot easily handle ultra-long histories typical of TSDBs. There is also a lack of benchmarks tailored to natural language querying over TSDB-scale data, making systematic evaluation difficult.

Method: The authors propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework using a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. First, a feature index over time-series data is used to retrieve candidate windows via SQL, analogous to sonar 'pings.' Second, the system generates Python programs that operate on the raw time-series signals to verify whether each candidate actually satisfies the user’s natural language query, effectively 'locking on' to correct matches. This combines symbolic querying over indexed features with neural or programmatic verification over the raw series.

Result: Through experiments on NLQTSBench, a newly introduced large-scale benchmark for natural language queries over TSDB-scale histories, the authors show that existing methods struggle with the complex temporal and morphological aspects of these queries. Sonar-TS outperforms traditional Text-to-SQL and pure time-series approaches on these tasks, better handling long histories and intricate temporal intent.

Conclusion: Sonar-TS demonstrates that a neuro-symbolic, search-then-verify architecture is effective for natural language querying in large time-series databases, addressing limitations of existing methods. The introduction of NLQTSBench provides a standardized way to evaluate such systems. Together, they constitute the first systematic study and general framework for NLQ4TSDB, laying groundwork and benchmarks for future research in this area.

Abstract: Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases (NLQ4TSDB) aims to assist non-expert users retrieve meaningful events, intervals, and summaries from massive temporal records. However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.

### [66] [Cinder: A fast and fair matchmaking system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17015)
*Saurav Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system for online games that achieves fast and fair matching of pre-made lobbies with heterogeneous skill distributions using range-based filtering and distribution-distance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing matchmaking systems that rely on simple aggregate team metrics (like mean or median rank) fail when team skill distributions are wide or skewed, causing unfair and one-sided matches that hurt player retention and satisfaction. There is a need for a system that can handle heterogeneous, pre-made lobbies while remaining computationally efficient at scale.

Method: Introduce Cinder, a two-stage algorithm. Stage 1: quickly filter candidate lobby pairs by comparing their non-outlier skill ranges using the Ruzicka similarity index, discarding obviously incompatible matches. Stage 2: for remaining candidates, map individual player ranks to non-linear skill buckets derived from an inverted normal distribution (increasing granularity around average skill). Compute fairness via Kantorovich distance between the two lobbies’ sorted bucket indices, producing a scalar "Sanction Score" indicating how fair the match is. Then analyze the distribution of these scores using 140M simulated lobby pairings to determine reasonable fairness thresholds.

Result: From 140 million simulated lobby pairings, the authors obtain a distribution of Sanction Scores that empirically characterizes how (un)fair typical pairings are under their system. This distribution supports choosing thresholds that distinguish acceptable from unacceptable matches and demonstrates Cinder can operate at scale while maintaining fairness guarantees.

Conclusion: Cinder can efficiently and fairly match heterogeneous pre-made lobbies by combining a fast similarity-based pre-filter with a principled distribution-distance fairness metric built on non-linear skill bucketing. The large-scale simulation suggests that its Sanction Score provides a robust basis for defining matchmaking fairness thresholds, making it a practical approach for modern multiplayer online games.

Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.

### [67] [M2F: Automated Formalization of Mathematical Literature at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17016)
*Zichen Wang,Wanli Ma,Zhenyu Ming,Gong Zhang,Kun Yuan,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces M2F, an agentic framework that automatically converts long-form mathematical texts into large, compiling Lean libraries, achieving near-expert-scale textbook formalization speed and high proof success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While automated formalization can verify individual theorems, it does not scale to entire textbooks or research papers. Existing systems struggle with cross-file dependencies, import resolution, and keeping large projects compiling end-to-end. This gap prevents practical, broad adoption of mechanized verification across real mathematical literature, which is typically organized as long documents rather than isolated statements. The authors aim to bridge this gap and show that large-scale, end-to-end autoformalization is feasible in a modern proof assistant (Lean).

Method: They propose M2F (Math-to-Formal), an agentic, verifier-in-the-loop framework with two main stages. (1) Statement compilation: the system splits a mathematical document into atomic blocks (e.g., definitions, theorems), infers and orders dependencies between them, and incrementally repairs declaration skeletons until the overall Lean project compiles, allowing proofs to be placeholders initially. (2) Proof repair: with the statement signatures fixed, the system iteratively fills the remaining proof holes using goal-conditioned local edits. In both stages, M2F uses the Lean toolchain as a critic, committing only those edits that improve compilation or proof status. This yields an end-to-end pipeline from raw text to a compiling Lean project with completed proofs.

Result: Using M2F for about three weeks on long-form sources (479 pages of textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis), the authors automatically generate a Lean library comprising 153,853 lines, where the content is fully formalized into Lean declarations with proofs. On the FATE-H benchmark, M2F attains a 96% proof success rate, surpassing a strong baseline at 80%. These results demonstrate both scalability (textbook-level coverage) and strong proof completion performance.

Conclusion: M2F shows that project-scale, automated formalization of mathematical literature in Lean is now practically achievable. By managing dependencies, compilation, and iterative proof repair in a verifier-in-the-loop agentic framework, the system can convert hundreds of pages of mathematical text into a large, compiling formal library in weeks instead of months or years of human expert work. This suggests that large-scale, automated mechanization of existing mathematical knowledge is within reach and provides a concrete tool and dataset (released Lean code) for future research in autoformalization.

Abstract: Automated formalization of mathematics enables mechanical verification but remains limited to isolated theorems and short snippets. Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\%$ proof success (vs.\ $80\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach. The full generated Lean code from our runs is available at https://github.com/optsuite/ReasBook.git.

TL;DR: Presents an AI-driven Sales Research Agent for Dynamics 365 Sales plus a dedicated benchmark (Sales Research Bench) to transparently evaluate its quality on live CRM data question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises want AI tools that can answer complex, sales-leader questions over their live, customized CRM systems, but they lack transparent and repeatable ways to measure and compare the quality of such AI systems. Existing models do not provide sufficiently observable evidence of quality, especially across multiple dimensions relevant to enterprise users.

Method: They design and implement the Sales Research Agent, an AI-first application integrated with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales that connects to live CRM and related data, reasons over complex schemas, and generates text and chart-based insights. In parallel, they build the Sales Research Bench, a specialized benchmark with eight customer-weighted evaluation dimensions (text/chart groundedness, relevance, explainability, schema accuracy, chart quality, etc.) and use it to quantitatively assess systems by running 200 questions on a customized enterprise CRM schema.

Result: On a 200-question evaluation conducted on October 19, 2025, over a customized enterprise CRM schema, the Sales Research Agent achieved a composite quality score that is 13 points higher than Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 24.1 points higher than ChatGPT-5 on the 100-point Sales Research Bench metric, demonstrating superior performance on customer-weighted dimensions.

Conclusion: The proposed Sales Research Agent effectively delivers decision-ready sales insights from live CRM data and, when evaluated with the new Sales Research Bench, outperforms leading general-purpose AI models across multiple enterprise-relevant quality dimensions. The benchmark offers customers a repeatable, transparent framework to compare and select AI solutions for sales analytics and decision support.

Abstract: Enterprises increasingly need AI systems that can answer sales-leader questions over live, customized CRM data, but most available models do not expose transparent, repeatable evidence of quality. This paper describes the Sales Research Agent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, an AI-first application that connects to live CRM and related data, reasons over complex schemas, and produces decision-ready insights through text and chart outputs. To make quality observable, we introduce the Sales Research Bench, a purpose-built benchmark that scores systems on eight customer-weighted dimensions, including text and chart groundedness, relevance, explainability, schema accuracy, and chart quality. In a 200-question run on a customized enterprise schema on October 19, 2025, the Sales Research Agent outperformed Claude Sonnet 4.5 by 13 points and ChatGPT-5 by 24.1 points on the 100-point composite score, giving customers a repeatable way to compare AI solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-policy RL for LLM agents suffers from simplicity bias: simple tasks dominate gradient updates and capacity, leaving complex tasks under-served. Naive MoE with token-level routing fragments temporally coherent behavior patterns, preventing experts from learning stable, phase-specific skills.

Method: Introduce PA-MoE, where a lightweight phase router learns latent temporal/phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defined phases. The router assigns whole phases (temporally consistent segments of trajectories) to experts instead of routing each token separately, maintaining phase-consistent expert specialization within the policy network.

Result: Experiments (details not in the abstract) show that PA-MoE improves performance of RL-trained LLM agents compared to standard single-policy and traditional token-level MoE approaches, indicating better handling of complex tasks and expert specialization.

Conclusion: Phase-level routing in MoE, learned directly from RL signals, mitigates simplicity bias and preserves phase-specific expertise, leading to more effective RL policies for LLM agents than traditional single-policy or token-level MoE methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \emph{single} policy network, causing \emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE.

### [70] [Dynamic System Instructions and Tool Exposure for Efficient Agentic LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17046)
*Uria Franko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a RAG-style method that dynamically retrieves only the necessary instruction fragments and tools for each LLM agent step, drastically cutting context size and cost while improving tool routing and enabling longer, cheaper agent runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents typically re-ingest long, static system prompts and full tool catalogs at every step, which wastes tokens, increases latency and cost, raises derailment risk, and worsens tool-selection accuracy, especially for long-running agents. The authors want a way to make agents more efficient and robust by only loading what is actually needed at each step.

Method: They propose Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a retrieval-augmented generation variant that (1) indexes system instructions and tool descriptions as retrievable fragments, (2) at each agent step retrieves only the minimal relevant instruction fragments and a small, high-confidence subset of tools, and (3) builds a dynamic runtime system prompt and narrowed toolset. The method includes confidence-gated fallbacks to expand retrieval when needed, along with an evaluation protocol, ablation studies, and deployment guidance.

Result: On a controlled benchmark with consistent numeric assumptions, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and lowers overall episode cost by 70% compared with a monolithic, full-instructions-and-tools baseline. These savings allow agents to perform 2–20 times more reasoning loops within the same context window.

Conclusion: ITR makes LLM agents significantly more scalable and cost-effective, particularly for long-running autonomous setups, by retrieving only the necessary instruction and tool information at each step instead of re-supplying a large, static system prompt and full tool catalog. The paper concludes that ITR is a practical, deployable way to improve efficiency, reliability, and tool routing for complex agent systems, and provides methodological and operational details to support adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents often run for many steps while re-ingesting long system instructions and large tool catalogs each turn. This increases cost, agent derailment probability, latency, and tool-selection errors. We propose Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a RAG variant that retrieves, per step, only the minimal system-prompt fragments and the smallest necessary subset of tools. ITR composes a dynamic runtime system prompt and exposes a narrowed toolset with confidence-gated fallbacks. Using a controlled benchmark with internally consistent numbers, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and cuts end-to-end episode cost by 70% versus a monolithic baseline. These savings enable agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits. Savings compound with the number of agent steps, making ITR particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents. We detail the method, evaluation protocol, ablations, and operational guidance for practical deployment.

### [71] [IntentCUA: Learning Intent-level Representations for Skill Abstraction and Multi-Agent Planning in Computer-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17049)
*Seoyoung Lee,Seobin Yoon,Seongbeen Lee,Yoojung Chun,Dayoung Park,Doyeon Kim,Joo Yong Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentCUA is a multi-agent computer-use framework that improves long-horizon desktop automation by using intent-aligned plan memory and reusable skills to stabilize execution and reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon computer-use agents struggle with noisy perception, multi-window contexts, and changing desktop environments, which cause drift from user intent, repeated solving of routine subproblems, and error accumulation, making existing RL-based and trajectory-retrieval methods inefficient and unreliable.

Method: The authors propose IntentCUA, a multi-agent framework with a Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic that coordinate via a shared plan memory. This memory abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, which reduces redundant re-planning and mitigates error propagation across applications. The system is evaluated end-to-end and through ablations against RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines.

Result: IntentCUA achieves a 74.83% task success rate and a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablation studies indicate that both multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory improve execution stability, and that the cooperative multi-agent loop yields the largest gains on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: System-level intent abstraction combined with memory-grounded coordination across multiple agents is crucial for reliable and efficient long-horizon desktop automation. By leveraging intent-aligned plan memory and reusable skills, IntentCUA stabilizes execution, reduces error propagation, and outperforms existing methods in large, dynamic computer-use environments.

Abstract: Computer-use agents operate over long horizons under noisy perception, multi-window contexts, evolving environment states. Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks. These results highlight that system-level intent abstraction and memory-grounded coordination are key to reliable and efficient desktop automation in large, dynamic environments.

### [72] [RFEval: Benchmarking Reasoning Faithfulness under Counterfactual Reasoning Intervention in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17053)
*Yunseok Han,Yejoon Lee,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper defines and measures how faithful large reasoning models’ explanations are to their actual decision process, and shows that current training methods often hurt this faithfulness even when accuracy looks good.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models can give correct answers with plausible-sounding explanations that may not reflect how the model actually arrived at the answer. This gap threatens reliability, auditing, and trust, because evaluators may incorrectly assume that a good explanation implies a sound internal reasoning process. There is therefore a need for a formal, testable notion of “reasoning faithfulness” and practical tools to measure it, separate from accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness based on two criteria: (1) stance consistency, meaning the explanation’s stance connects coherently to the final answer; and (2) causal influence, meaning that the stated reasoning causally affects the answer when subjected to controlled, output-level interventions. They then create RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven reasoning-heavy tasks. RFEval applies controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions on model rationales to test whether the model’s answers change consistently with the altered reasoning. They evaluate twelve open-source large reasoning models, including variants trained with different post-training regimes such as RL-style objectives and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Across 12 open-source LRMs on RFEval, the authors find that about 49.7% of model outputs are unfaithful by their criteria, with most failures due to stance inconsistency between explanation and answer. Unfaithfulness is especially common in brittle, convergent domains like math and code. They observe that reasoning faithfulness correlates more strongly with post-training methods than with model size: within-family ablations show that adding current RL-style post-training on top of supervised fine-tuning can decrease faithfulness, even when accuracy does not drop. Statistical analysis reveals that, once controlling for model and task, accuracy has only a weak and insignificant relationship with faithfulness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that high accuracy alone does not guarantee faithful reasoning or trustworthy explanations in large reasoning models. Their formal framework and RFEval benchmark provide a rigorous way to audit reasoning faithfulness via stance consistency and causal influence tests. They argue that building trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correctness of final answers but also for the structural integrity and causal relevance of the produced reasoning. They release code and data to support further research on faithful reasoning and better post-training objectives.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

### [73] [Retaining Suboptimal Actions to Follow Shifting Optima in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17062)
*Yonghyeon Jo,Sunwoo Lee,Seungyul Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2Q, a value decomposition method for cooperative MARL that learns multiple sub-value functions and uses a Softmax behavior policy to maintain diverse high-value actions and better adapt to shifting optima, outperforming prior MARL methods on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cooperative MARL value decomposition methods typically focus on a single optimal joint action. During training, as the value landscape changes, this single-action focus can cause premature commitment to a suboptimal solution and poor adaptability because alternative high-value actions are forgotten. There is a need for a value decomposition framework that can preserve multiple promising actions and adjust quickly as the underlying optimal policy shifts.

Method: The authors propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q). Instead of learning a single total value function that implicitly assumes one optimal action, S2Q learns multiple sub-value functions, each capturing different high-value modes of the action space. These sub-value functions are combined within a Softmax-based behavior policy, which probabilistically favors all high-value actions rather than greedily selecting only the top one. This design promotes persistent exploration and maintains a set of competitive actions, allowing the overall joint action-value function Q^tot to track changes in the optimal actions more effectively during training.

Result: On challenging cooperative MARL benchmarks, S2Q achieves consistently better performance compared to various existing MARL algorithms based on value decomposition and related approaches. The empirical results indicate that S2Q attains higher returns and displays stronger adaptability when the underlying optimal policies change, validating the benefits of learning multiple sub-value functions and using a Softmax-based behavior policy.

Conclusion: S2Q addresses the limitation of standard value decomposition methods that over-commit to a single optimal action by learning multiple sub-value functions and integrating them into a Softmax-based policy. This leads to more robust exploration, faster adaptation to shifting optima, and superior overall performance on cooperative MARL benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly modeling alternative high-value actions is a promising direction for future MARL algorithms.

Abstract: Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

### [74] [Predictive Batch Scheduling: Accelerating Language Model Training Through Loss-Aware Sample Prioritization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17066)
*Sumedh Rasal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper proposes Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS) to speed up language model training by focusing batches on predicted high-loss samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curriculum learning and hard example mining can improve training but need either predefined difficulty metrics or expensive per-sample loss tracking. The authors want a cheaper, more automatic way to identify hard samples during training.

Method: Use a lightweight linear predictor, trained online during training, to estimate per-sample loss (difficulty) from four static token-level features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Construct training batches by dynamically prioritizing samples with higher predicted loss. Track how well the predictor correlates with true loss over training.

Result: On a 130M parameter transformer, PBS yields 6–13% faster convergence in evaluation loss versus standard training, across checkpoints. The predictor's correlation with true loss improves from 0.14 to 0.44 over the first 10,000 training steps.

Conclusion: Token-frequency-based static features can effectively approximate sample difficulty, enabling a practical, low-overhead curriculum-learning-style batching strategy that measurably accelerates language model convergence.

Abstract: We introduce Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS), a novel training optimization technique that accelerates language model convergence by dynamically prioritizing high-loss samples during batch construction. Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead.

### [75] [How AI Coding Agents Communicate: A Study of Pull Request Description Characteristics and Human Review Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17084)
*Kan Watanabe,Rikuto Tsuchida,Takahiro Monno,Bin Huang,Kazuma Yamasaki,Youmei Fan,Kazumasa Shimari,Kenichi Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper empirically studies how pull requests (PRs) created by different AI coding agents on GitHub differ in their written descriptions, and how those differences affect human reviewers’ behavior and merge outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI coding agents are increasingly able to autonomously open PRs on GitHub, but we lack understanding of how these agents differ in how they present their PRs and how humans respond. Since PR descriptions strongly influence code review quality, speed, and merge decisions, understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective human-AI collaboration in software development and for designing better AI agents and workflows.

Method: Using the AIDev dataset, the authors select PRs created by five distinct AI coding agents. They empirically analyze and compare the PR description characteristics across agents, including structural features (e.g., organization, length, formatting, detail). They then examine human reviewer responses to these PRs along several dimensions: review activity (amount of review), response timing (how fast reviewers reply), sentiment (tone of responses), and merge outcomes (whether PRs are merged). Statistical or comparative analyses are applied to identify associations between agent-specific PR styles and reviewer behaviors/outcomes.

Result: Different AI agents exhibit clearly distinct PR description styles and structural patterns. These stylistic/structural differences correlate with measurable differences in human reviewer engagement (how much they interact), response speed, and whether PRs get merged. There is notable variation between agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates, indicating that some agents elicit more favorable or faster human responses than others, potentially due to how they present their changes.

Conclusion: The style and structure of PR descriptions produced by AI coding agents matter for human-AI collaboration: different agents induce different reviewer behaviors and merge outcomes. PR presentation is not merely cosmetic but plays a substantive role in review dynamics and success rates. Designing and tuning AI coding agents to produce more effective PR descriptions could improve collaboration efficiency, reviewer experience, and integration success in software development workflows.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models has led to the emergence of AI coding agents that autonomously create pull requests on GitHub. However, how these agents differ in their pull request description characteristics, and how human reviewers respond to them, remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of pull requests created by five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset. We analyze agent differences in pull request description characteristics, including structural features, and examine human reviewer response in terms of review activity, response timing, sentiment, and merge outcomes. We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. We observe notable variation across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates. These findings highlight the role of pull request presentation and reviewer interaction dynamics in human-AI collaborative software development.

### [76] [Agentic Wireless Communication for 6G: Intent-Aware and Continuously Evolving Physical-Layer Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17096)
*Zhaoyang Li,Xingzhi Jin,Junyu Pan,Qianqian Yang,Zhiguo Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large language model (LLM)-based, intent-aware agents to enable autonomous, user-intent-driven control at the 6G physical layer, and demonstrates this via a link decision agent called AgenCom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G networks face increasing functional complexity and highly diverse, time-varying user service demands that can no longer be expressed or managed through single performance metrics (like only throughput or only reliability) or rigid rule-based control. Traditional designs struggle to understand rich user intents (e.g., latency, energy, computation limits, service-level preferences) and dynamic environments in a unified way, limiting autonomy and sustainable evolution of 6G systems. There is a need for mechanisms that can perceive complex intents, interpret them, and act on them across heterogeneous information sources.

Method: The authors conceptually design and analyze an agentic AI framework for the 6G physical layer built around a closed-loop of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution. They position large language models as core intent-aware network agents that can parse natural language user intents and heterogeneous contextual information, and then map them to concrete control/configuration actions. The paper reviews representative physical-layer tasks and explains why they are limited for intent awareness and autonomy, identifies scenarios where agentic LLM-based AI is beneficial, and outlines enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. They also implement or at least detail a case study of an LLM-based intent-driven link decision agent, AgenCom, that adaptively configures communication links under varying user preferences and channel conditions.

Result: Conceptually, the paper shows that agentic AI powered by LLMs can provide a unified interface between natural language user intents and physical-layer control decisions. Through the AgenCom case study, they demonstrate that an intent-driven link decision agent can adapt link configurations to heterogeneous and dynamic user preferences and channel states, highlighting advantages over rigid, rule-based, or purely centrally optimized schemes. The results illustrate feasibility and benefits in terms of flexibility, intent-awareness, and autonomy at the 6G physical layer.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLM-based, intent-aware agentic AI is a promising paradigm for enabling autonomous, user-intent-driven control in 6G physical-layer systems. By forming a closed loop of intent perception, decision making, and execution, such agents can overcome limitations of traditional rule-based or single-metric designs, better integrate heterogeneous information, and more effectively satisfy complex, dynamic service requirements. The authors argue that realizing this vision requires advances in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision processes, and sustainable optimization, and they position their AgenCom case study as an illustrative step toward practical implementations.

Abstract: As 6G wireless systems evolve, growing functional complexity and diverse service demands are driving a shift from rule-based control to intent-driven autonomous intelligence. User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.
  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.
  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.

### [77] [Toward Trustworthy Evaluation of Sustainability Rating Methodologies: A Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Benchmark Dataset Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17106)
*Xiaoran Cai,Wang Yang,Xiyu Ren,Chekun Law,Rohit Sharma,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal human-AI framework to create benchmark datasets and analyze discrepancies in sustainability (ESG) ratings, aiming to make ratings more comparable, credible, and useful for decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG/sustainability ratings for the same company differ significantly across rating agencies, which undermines their comparability, credibility, and usefulness for investors, regulators, and other decision-makers. There is a need for a standardized, scalable way to evaluate and improve rating methodologies so they can better support sustainability agendas.

Method: The authors introduce a two-part human-AI collaboration framework. First, STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating & Integrity Data Equation) defines principled criteria and a scoring system for constructing firm-level benchmark datasets, leveraging large language models to process company disclosures and external data. Second, SR-Delta is a discrepancy-analysis procedure that compares rating outputs, surfaces systematic inconsistencies, and generates insights for potential methodological adjustments. Together, they use LLMs and structured criteria to build reference datasets and analyze rating differences across agencies.

Result: The framework conceptually demonstrates how to use LLM-based benchmarks and structured discrepancy analysis to evaluate and compare different sustainability rating methodologies in a scalable and consistent way. It yields insights into where and why rating methodologies diverge, and provides a structured basis for adjusting or calibrating them. The result is a proposed path toward more harmonized and trustworthy ESG ratings, though detailed empirical outcomes are not fully described in the abstract.

Conclusion: By adopting the proposed universal human-AI collaboration framework—STRIDE for benchmark dataset construction and SR-Delta for discrepancy analysis—the sustainability ecosystem can move toward more comparable, credible, and decision-useful ESG ratings. The authors encourage the AI and sustainability communities to leverage AI, particularly LLMs, to strengthen and evolve sustainability rating methodologies that are aligned with pressing sustainability goals.

Abstract: Sustainability or ESG rating agencies use company disclosures and external data to produce scores or ratings that assess the environmental, social, and governance performance of a company. However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies. The framework comprises two complementary parts: STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating & Integrity Data Equation) provides principled criteria and a scoring system that guide the construction of firm-level benchmark datasets using large language models (LLMs), and SR-Delta, a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments. The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas.

### [78] [Owen-based Semantics and Hierarchy-Aware Explanation (O-Shap)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17107)
*Xiangyu Zhou,Chenhan Xiao,Yang Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces O-Shap, an Owen value-based XAI method that builds a hierarchical, semantically consistent feature grouping to improve SHAP explanations in structured domains like images and tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Shapley value-based XAI methods assume independent features, which is rarely true in vision and other structured domains where neighboring pixels or features are strongly dependent. Modern SHAP implementations add the Owen value to handle feature groups, but the quality of explanations now heavily depends on how these groups (segments) are defined. Common segmentation schemes such as axis-aligned grids or SLIC superpixels can violate theoretical consistency properties and hurt both interpretability and faithfulness of explanations. The authors aim to design a grouping/segmentation strategy that is theoretically well-founded, semantically meaningful, and computationally efficient for Owen value-based explanations.

Method: The authors analyze the consistency properties required for meaningful Owen value attributions and identify that widely used segmentation approaches fail some of these properties. They formalize a new structural condition, the T-property, that enforces semantic alignment and consistency across hierarchical levels of feature groups. Based on this, they propose a novel segmentation method that constructs a feature hierarchy (for images and tabular data) satisfying the T-property. This hierarchy allows computing Owen value-based attributions (O-Shap) with pruning strategies that reduce the computational burden while preserving or improving faithfulness of the explanations. The method is implemented for image and tabular settings and compared to existing SHAP variants and grouping schemes.

Result: Empirical evaluations on image and tabular datasets show that O-Shap yields more accurate and semantically coherent feature attributions than baseline SHAP and Owen value implementations using standard segmentations such as axis-aligned patches or SLIC superpixels. The proposed T-property-based hierarchy improves attribution precision, aligns better with human-interpretable structures, and enables computational pruning that leads to faster runtimes. Across the tested benchmarks, O-Shap consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly in scenarios where the underlying data has strong structural dependencies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that naive or ad hoc feature groupings undermine the theoretical advantages of Owen value-based XAI. By introducing the T-property and a corresponding segmentation strategy, the authors provide a principled way to build hierarchies that respect both the theory of cooperative game-based attributions and the semantic structure of real data. Their O-Shap method delivers more faithful, interpretable, and efficient explanations on structured domains, suggesting that future XAI work using Shapley/Owen values should treat group structure design as a first-class component rather than a minor implementation detail.

Abstract: Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.

### [79] [Instructor-Aligned Knowledge Graphs for Personalized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17111)
*Abdulrahman AlRabah,Priyanka Kargupta,Jiawei Han,Abdussalam Alawini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstructKG, a framework that automatically builds instructor-aligned knowledge graphs from lecture materials to represent course concepts and their learning dependencies for personalized education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex educational concepts depends on grasping both their prerequisites and constituent sub-concepts (e.g., learning recursion before merge sort, or merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). In large-scale courses, instructors cannot manually diagnose each student's conceptual gaps or identify which specific concepts need reinforcement. Existing knowledge graph approaches are too coarse (course-level concepts or enrollment relationships) and fail to exploit the rich pedagogical cues in instructional materials. There is a need for an automated method that captures fine-grained, instructor-intended learning progressions to better support personalized learning and targeted interventions.

Method: The authors propose InstructKG, a framework that takes as input a course’s lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.) and automatically constructs a knowledge graph that reflects the instructor’s intended conceptual progression. The system first extracts important concepts from the materials and represents them as nodes. It then infers directed edges between these nodes to encode learning dependencies, such as “part-of” and “depends-on” relationships. InstructKG leverages temporal signals (e.g., the order in which topics appear in the lectures) and semantic signals (e.g., co-occurrence and definitional use of concepts, such as recursion being used in the definition of merge sort), and combines these education-specific cues with the general reasoning and language understanding capabilities of large language models to infer accurate concept relationships.

Result: In experiments using diverse lecture materials from multiple real-world courses, the authors construct knowledge graphs with InstructKG and evaluate them through human judgments. The evaluation indicates that the resulting graphs successfully capture rich conceptual relationships and align well with instructors’ intended learning progressions, suggesting that the approach can accurately model prerequisite and part-of structures within courses.

Conclusion: InstructKG effectively and automatically produces instructor-aligned knowledge graphs from lecture materials, modeling both prerequisite and compositional relationships among fine-grained concepts. By exploiting temporal and semantic patterns in educational content in combination with large language models, the framework generates learning progressions that agree with human instructor intent. This capability supports better identification of student knowledge gaps and lays groundwork for scalable, personalized instruction and targeted support in large courses.

Abstract: Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like "Algorithms" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., "recursion" is taught before "mergesort"; "recursion" is mentioned in the definition of "merge sort") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.

### [80] [Epistemology of Generative AI: The Geometry of Knowing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17116)
*Ilya Levin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new epistemological framework for understanding how generative AI systems produce knowledge, grounded in the geometry of high-dimensional representation spaces rather than traditional symbolic or purely statistical views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing philosophical and technical accounts of information and knowledge assume a Turing-Shannon-von Neumann paradigm, where information is encoded as symbolic or binary data and semantics is external to computation. Generative AI, especially large neural networks, do not fit this framework well: they operate via internal high-dimensional representations whose epistemic status is poorly understood. Without a principled account of how these systems represent and manipulate meaning, we lack a sound basis for integrating them into science, education, and institutions in a responsible way. The paper aims to fill this conceptual gap.

Method: The paper undertakes a conceptual and philosophical analysis grounded in the mathematics of high-dimensional geometry and the theory of neural network representations. It identifies four structural properties of high-dimensional spaces—concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity—and uses these to articulate how generative models organize and navigate a ‘space of meanings.’ It then synthesizes this with Peirce’s semiotics and Papert’s constructionism to construct an "Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces," treating generative models as agents that navigate learned manifolds rather than as mere symbol processors or statistical aggregators.

Result: The paper develops the notion that neural networks transform symbolic inputs into positions in a high-dimensional semantic space, where each coordinate corresponds to a semantic parameter. In this framework, generative models are described as navigators traversing learned manifolds within this space. By leveraging properties of high-dimensional geometry, the paper characterizes how generative models can systematically produce coherent outputs. It introduces and motivates the concept of "navigational knowledge"—a distinct epistemic category that captures how these systems exploit geometric structure to generate content, separate from classical symbolic reasoning and naive statistical recombination.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that generative AI requires a new epistemological paradigm: an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. In this view, the core of generative AI’s epistemic activity is not symbolic manipulation or mere pattern matching but navigation within learned semantic manifolds. This yields a third, irreducible mode of knowledge production—navigational knowledge—that must be recognized alongside symbolic and statistical modes. Adopting this framework can ground more principled approaches to deploying generative AI in scientific inquiry, education, and institutional practice, and it calls for further philosophical and technical work built around the geometry of high-dimensional representation spaces.

Abstract: Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production. Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination.

### [81] [Efficient Parallel Algorithm for Decomposing Hard CircuitSAT Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17130)
*Victor Kondratiev,Irina Gribanova,Alexander Semenov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new parameterized parallel algorithm decomposes hard CircuitSAT instances into weaker subformulas using specialized constraints, enabling efficient, hardness-guided search and showing good performance on equivalence checking and cryptographic preimage problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard CircuitSAT instances, such as those from logical equivalence checking and cryptographic preimage attacks, are often difficult for standard SAT solvers. Decomposing these large, complex formulas into more manageable parts can make them easier to solve, but finding good decompositions is itself challenging. The authors aim to design a systematic, scalable way—exploiting parallelism—to obtain high-quality decompositions that preserve useful structure while reducing hardness.

Method: They introduce a parallel, parameterized algorithm that takes an original CircuitSAT instance and uses specialized constraints to partition it into a family of weakened SAT formulas. Parameters control how the decomposition is performed, trading off between the number, size, and difficulty of subinstances. In parallel, the system estimates the hardness of many candidate decompositions and uses these estimates to select high-quality ones efficiently.

Result: Experiments on difficult CircuitSAT benchmarks show that the proposed method can produce decompositions that are practically useful for solving the underlying problems. In particular, it works well on instances arising from logical equivalence checking of Boolean circuits and preimage attacks on cryptographic hash functions, indicating improved practical performance compared to not using such decomposition strategies.

Conclusion: A parameterized parallel decomposition strategy, guided by parallel hardness estimation and implemented via specialized constraints, is an effective way to tackle challenging CircuitSAT instances. The approach yields high-quality weakened subformulas that help in practice on real-world tasks such as circuit equivalence checking and cryptographic preimage problems, suggesting that parallel, hardness-aware decomposition is a promising direction for SAT solving on complex circuit-based instances.

Abstract: We propose a novel parallel algorithm for decomposing hard CircuitSAT instances. The technique employs specialized constraints to partition an original SAT instance into a family of weakened formulas. Our approach is implemented as a parameterized parallel algorithm, where adjusting the parameters allows efficient identification of high-quality decompositions, guided by hardness estimations computed in parallel. We demonstrate the algorithm's practical efficacy on challenging CircuitSAT instances, including those encoding Logical Equivalence Checking of Boolean circuits and preimage attacks on cryptographic hash functions.

### [82] [Bonsai: A Framework for Convolutional Neural Network Acceleration Using Criterion-Based Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17145)
*Joseph Bingham,Sam Helmich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Combine, a unified, fast framework for criterion-based iterative pruning of CNNs, showing large filter and computation reductions with maintained or improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are becoming larger and more resource-intensive in terms of execution time, memory, and power. Existing pruning methods use different, incompatible criteria and implementations, making them hard to reproduce, compare, and deploy. The authors aim to provide a common, efficient framework and language for criterion-based pruning and to explore how different criteria affect different CNN architectures.

Method: They design Combine, a criterion-based iterative pruning framework that can plug in various pruning criteria. They formalize a standard representation ("language") for pruning criteria, implement multiple existing and novel criteria within this framework, and apply iterative filter pruning to VGG-like CNN models. They then measure remaining accuracy and computational cost after pruning under different criteria.

Result: On VGG-inspired models, their criteria within the Combine framework can prune up to 79% of convolutional filters while maintaining or even improving model accuracy, and can reduce the computational load (e.g., FLOPs) by up to 68%. They also empirically show that different criteria have distinct effects depending on the model used.

Conclusion: A unified, criterion-based pruning framework like Combine can efficiently support and compare multiple pruning strategies, enabling substantial reductions in filters and computations with little or no accuracy loss. Different pruning criteria interact differently with different architectures, so having a common formalism and implementation is valuable for systematic comparison and for designing new, effective pruning criteria.

Abstract: As the need for more accurate and powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) increases, so too does the size, execution time, memory footprint, and power consumption. To overcome this, solutions such as pruning have been proposed with their own metrics and methodologies, or criteria, for how weights should be removed. These solutions do not share a common implementation and are difficult to implement and compare. In this work, we introduce Combine, a criterion- based pruning solution and demonstrate that it is fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, demonstrate that criterion have differing effects on different models, create a standard language for comparing criterion functions, and propose a few novel criterion functions. We show the capacity of these criterion functions and the framework on VGG inspired models, pruning up to 79\% of filters while retaining or improving accuracy, and reducing the computations needed by the network by up to 68\%.

### [83] [JEPA-DNA: Grounding Genomic Foundation Models through Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17162)
*Ariel Larey,Elay Dahan,Amit Bleiweiss,Raizy Kellerman,Guy Leib,Omri Nayshool,Dan Ofer,Tal Zinger,Dan Dominissini,Gideon Rechavi,Nicole Bussola,Simon Lee,Shane O'Connell,Dung Hoang,Marissa Wirth,Alexander W. Charney,Nati Daniel,Yoli Shavit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces JEPA-DNA, a genomic foundation model pre-training framework that combines generative objectives with joint-embedding prediction to capture both local sequence features and high-level functional context, improving performance on downstream genomic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing genomic foundation models trained with MLM or next-token prediction capture local nucleotide patterns well but struggle to learn global, functional representations of DNA sequences. This limits their biological utility, especially for tasks requiring an understanding of broader functional logic rather than only local motifs. The work aims to design a pre-training objective that grounds sequence representations in higher-level biological function, leading to more globally informative embeddings.

Method: The authors propose JEPA-DNA, which integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative pre-training (MLM/NTP). The method adds a latent grounding mechanism by supervising a CLS token to predict high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments in latent space, alongside standard token-level recovery. This joint objective encourages the model to learn representations that connect local nucleotide patterns to global functional context. JEPA-DNA can be used as a standalone pre-training objective from scratch or as a continual pre-training layer on top of existing genomic foundation models.

Result: Across a broad range of genomic benchmarks, JEPA-DNA outperforms generative-only baselines in both supervised fine-tuning and zero-shot evaluation settings. The empirical results suggest that incorporating JEPA-based latent prediction yields more informative and biologically meaningful sequence representations than using MLM/NTP alone.

Conclusion: JEPA-DNA provides a scalable pre-training framework for genomic foundation models that better captures both local sequence syntax and global functional logic. By combining generative token-level objectives with JEPA-style latent prediction supervised via a CLS token, the approach produces more robust, biologically grounded embeddings and advances the development of foundation models that understand not just DNA sequence patterns but their functional implications.

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.

### [84] [Texo: Formula Recognition within 20M Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17189)
*Sicheng Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Texo is a compact, 20M-parameter formula recognition model that matches larger state-of-the-art systems while being lightweight enough for real-time and in-browser use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art formula recognition models (e.g., UniMERNet-T and PPFormulaNet-S) are accurate but large and computationally heavy, limiting real-time use and deployment on consumer hardware or in browsers. There is a need for a much smaller model that preserves high recognition quality while drastically reducing computational and memory requirements.

Method: Design a minimalist neural architecture (~20M parameters) for formula recognition, combined with careful vocabulary and tokenizer design. Use knowledge distillation and transfer techniques from larger, state-of-the-art models to Texo so that it can learn an efficient representation and output space despite its compact size.

Result: Texo attains recognition performance comparable to state-of-the-art formula recognition models UniMERNet-T and PPFormulaNet-S, while using 80% and 65% fewer parameters, respectively. Its small size allows real-time inference on typical consumer devices and enables in-browser deployment.

Conclusion: Through deliberate model design, vocabulary/tokenizer optimization, and distillation, it is possible to build a very compact formula recognition model that maintains near–state-of-the-art accuracy. Texo demonstrates that high-performance formula recognition can be delivered in real-time and in lightweight environments, and its accompanying web application showcases its practicality for end users.

Abstract: In this paper we present Texo, a minimalist yet highperformance formula recognition model that contains only 20 million parameters. By attentive design, distillation and transfer of the vocabulary and the tokenizer, Texo achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models such as UniMERNet-T and PPFormulaNet-S, while reducing the model size by 80% and 65%, respectively. This enables real-time inference on consumer-grade hardware and even in-browser deployment. We also developed a web application to demonstrate the model capabilities and facilitate its usage for end users.

### [85] [Continual learning and refinement of causal models through dynamic predicate invention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17217)
*Enrique Crespo-Fernandez,Oliver Ray,Telmo de Menezes e Silva Filho,Peter Flach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They introduce an online, symbolic causal world‑modeling framework that learns and repairs models during interaction, using Meta‑Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to build reusable relational abstractions that are far more sample‑efficient and scalable than a PPO baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world modeling approaches for agents in complex environments are sample‑hungry, opaque (hard to interpret), and do not scale well to relationally complex domains. The authors want agents that can understand and exploit the underlying causal and logical structure of their environment in a transparent and data‑efficient way, especially in settings where propositional or neural approaches face combinatorial explosion.

Method: They design an online framework in which an agent continuously learns and repairs a symbolic causal world model as part of its decision loop. The core technique is Meta‑Interpretive Learning with predicate invention, which automatically constructs higher‑level, semantically meaningful predicates from raw observations. This yields a hierarchy of disentangled symbolic concepts and supports lifted (relational) inference, allowing the model to reason at the level of entities and relations rather than propositionalized states. The learned model is updated online as the agent interacts with the environment.

Result: In domains characterized by complex relational dynamics, their lifted, symbolic inference approach scales better than propositional representations that suffer combinatorial blow‑up. Empirically, they report sample efficiency that is orders of magnitude higher than a standard PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) neural network baseline, while still handling relational complexity effectively.

Conclusion: Online symbolic causal modeling with Meta‑Interpretive Learning and predicate invention can yield interpretable, hierarchical world models that are both far more sample‑efficient and more scalable to relationally complex environments than conventional neural PPO baselines. This suggests that integrating continuous model learning/repair with symbolic abstraction is a promising direction for building more capable and data‑efficient agents in complex worlds.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating complex environments requires agents to internalize the underlying logic of their world, yet standard world modelling methods often struggle with sample inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor scalability. We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.

### [86] [From Labor to Collaboration: A Methodological Experiment Using AI Agents to Augment Research Perspectives in Taiwan's Humanities and Social Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17221)
*Yi-Chih Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes and demonstrates an AI Agent-based collaborative workflow (Agentic Workflow) tailored to humanities and social science research, using Taiwan Claude.ai usage data as a testbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most generative AI research and tooling currently target software engineering and natural sciences, with little methodological guidance for rigorously integrating AI into humanities and social science research. There is a need for a systematic, transparent, and replicable framework that defines how humans and AI should collaborate in research processes, while preserving human judgment and ethics.

Method: The authors design a seven-stage, modular AI Agent-based research workflow grounded in three core principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability. Each stage specifies distinct roles for human researchers (research judgment, theoretical framing, ethical decision-making) and AI Agents (information retrieval, text generation, procedural support). They then empirically apply this workflow to secondary data analysis using Taiwan’s Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations from the Anthropic Economic Index, November 2025), documenting the process and outputs to validate feasibility and quality.

Result: The workflow is shown to be practically applicable and replicable for humanities and social science research using secondary data. Through its application, the authors identify three concrete operational modes of human-AI collaboration: (1) direct execution, where AI performs well-defined tasks; (2) iterative refinement, where humans and AI co-adjust outputs through cycles; and (3) human-led collaboration, where humans retain primary control, using AI as a supportive tool. The empirical case demonstrates that the designed stages can be implemented and produce analyzable outputs (details in Appendix A).

Conclusion: The study concludes that an Agentic Workflow can structure rigorous, transparent human-AI collaboration in humanities and social science research, while affirming the irreplaceable role of human judgment in core intellectual tasks such as question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextual reasoning, and ethical reflection. The framework offers a replicable template but is limited by single-platform, cross-sectional data and by ongoing concerns about AI reliability and validity, which warrant cautious use and further research.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping knowledge work, yet existing research focuses predominantly on software engineering and the natural sciences, with limited methodological exploration for the humanities and social sciences. Positioned as a "methodological experiment," this study proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative research workflow (Agentic Workflow) for humanities and social science research. Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology.
  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).
  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection. Limitations including single-platform data, cross-sectional design, and AI reliability risks are acknowledged.

### [87] [Decoding the Human Factor: High Fidelity Behavioral Prediction for Strategic Foresight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17222)
*Ben Yellin,Ehud Ezra,Mark Foreman,Shula Grinapol*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a fine-tuned behavioral foundation model that predicts individual strategic decisions by conditioning on high-dimensional psychological trait profiles rather than simple persona prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs and prompting-based methods are poor at producing consistent, individual-specific behavior, especially when decisions depend on nuanced interactions between stable traits, current motivations, and situational constraints. Persona prompts are brittle, suffer from identity drift, and cannot effectively exploit rich psychological descriptions. There is a need for a scalable method that can accurately simulate and predict human strategic choices in high-stakes settings.

Method: The authors fine-tune an LLM backbone (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) on a proprietary dataset that links comprehensive psychometric batteries (stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational factors) to observed choices in various strategic dilemmas. They encode these rich trait profiles as structured, high-dimensional behavioral embeddings and condition the model on these embeddings to predict discrete actions. The model’s performance is compared to prompting-based baselines and frontier models, including settings where only Big Five traits are available versus denser trait profiles.

Result: LBM outperforms the base Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in predicting behavior in held-out scenarios and performs on par with strong frontier baselines when only Big Five traits are used. Unlike prompting-based approaches that hit a performance ceiling as persona complexity increases, LBM continues to improve as more trait dimensions are added, demonstrating its ability to effectively leverage increasingly dense psychological profiles.

Conclusion: LBM provides a scalable and higher-fidelity approach to behavioral simulation by grounding predictions in structured psychological trait embeddings rather than ad hoc persona prompts. Its ability to map rich trait profiles to strategic choices, and to benefit from additional trait dimensions, makes it a promising tool for applications such as strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.

### [88] [Mechanistic Interpretability of Cognitive Complexity in LLMs via Linear Probing using Bloom's Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17229)
*Bianca Raimondi,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that different levels of cognitive complexity, as defined by Bloom's Taxonomy, are linearly decodable from LLM activations, with about 95% accuracy, and that this separability strengthens across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond black-box, benchmark-only evaluation of LLMs and understand what kinds of cognitive distinctions are internally represented, specifically whether models internally encode the cognitive complexity (Bloom levels) of prompts.

Method: Use Bloom's Taxonomy to label prompts by cognitive level; collect high-dimensional activation vectors (residual stream representations) from multiple LLMs as they process these prompts; train simple linear classifiers on these activations to distinguish Bloom levels; analyze accuracy across layers to see where and how well cognitive level is encoded.

Result: Linear classifiers reach roughly 95% mean accuracy in classifying Bloom levels from model activations, and this accuracy improves in deeper layers, indicating that cognitive level becomes more cleanly represented as processing proceeds.

Conclusion: Cognitive complexity as defined by Bloom's Taxonomy is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of LLM residual stream representations, and models determine and refine this representation of task difficulty early and increasingly throughout the forward pass, offering a more interpretable view of their internal cognition.

Abstract: The black-box nature of Large Language Models necessitates novel evaluation frameworks that transcend surface-level performance metrics. This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.

### [89] [ArXiv-to-Model: A Practical Study of Scientific LM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17288)
*Anuj Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Case study describing how to train a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model from raw arXiv LaTeX, focusing on the full engineering and data pipeline rather than new architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although large language models show strong scientific and mathematical reasoning, there is little transparent, practical documentation on how to train smaller, domain-specialized scientific LMs from raw data under realistic compute constraints. Researchers with moderate resources lack guidance on end-to-end pipelines, trade-offs, and failure modes when building such models from scratch.

Method: The authors train a 1.36B-parameter dense transformer model on raw arXiv LaTeX sources across math, computer science, and theoretical physics. They construct an end-to-end pipeline including: (1) metadata filtering and archive validation of arXiv sources; (2) LaTeX extraction and text normalization tailored to scientific content; (3) domain-aware tokenization designed to better handle symbolic/mathematical text; and (4) training on constrained hardware (2×A100 GPUs) with 24 experimental runs. They systematically vary preprocessing, tokenization, and training settings to study training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks, and analyze convergence behavior with 52B pretraining tokens.

Result: The study reveals that: (1) preprocessing choices critically determine the amount of usable training data (token yield) extracted from raw LaTeX; (2) tokenization strategies significantly affect stability and quality, especially for symbolic/mathematical sequences; (3) non-compute factors such as storage and I/O throughput can become primary bottlenecks even with modest GPU resources; and (4) with appropriate design choices, a 1.36B-parameter model can be trained stably in a data-rich regime of 52B tokens on limited hardware. They provide empirical characterizations of scaling, convergence, and stability across their 24 runs.

Conclusion: The work concludes that building effective, domain-specialized scientific language models is feasible for researchers with moderate compute, but success depends heavily on engineering details of data preprocessing, tokenization, and infrastructure rather than novel architectures. By documenting a transparent, end-to-end process and the associated trade-offs and bottlenecks, the paper aims to serve as a practical blueprint and reference for others training small scientific LMs from scratch.

Abstract: While frontier large language models demonstrate strong reasoning and mathematical capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.

### [90] [All Leaks Count, Some Count More: Interpretable Temporal Contamination Detection in LLM Backtesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17234)
*Zeyu Zhang,Ryan Chen,Bradly C. Stadie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to detect and mitigate temporal knowledge leakage in LLM-based predictions, enabling valid backtesting of models on past events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate whether LLMs can predict future events, we must backtest them using only information available before a specified cutoff date. However, LLMs trained on future data can unintentionally use post-cutoff knowledge when generating rationales and predictions, invalidating such evaluations. There is a need for a principled, interpretable way to detect, quantify, and reduce this temporal leakage in the model’s reasoning process.

Method: The authors propose a claim-level analysis pipeline that first decomposes model rationales into atomic factual claims and labels each claim according to whether it is temporally verifiable before or after a given cutoff date. They then use Shapley values to determine each claim’s marginal contribution to the final prediction. This leads to a metric, Shapley-weighted Decision-Critical Leakage Rate (Shapley-DCLR), which measures what proportion of decision-driving reasoning is based on post-cutoff (leaked) information. Building on this, they introduce TimeSPEC (Time-Supervised Prediction with Extracted Claims), a generation procedure that alternates between generating, verifying, and, when necessary, regenerating claims to ensure all supporting claims can be justified from pre-cutoff sources.

Result: On 350 test instances across three domains—U.S. Supreme Court outcome prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking—the authors find that standard prompting baselines exhibit substantial temporal leakage in their rationales as measured by Shapley-DCLR. TimeSPEC significantly reduces Shapley-DCLR while maintaining comparable task performance to these baselines, showing that predictions can remain accurate even when removing decision-critical leaked information.

Conclusion: Temporal knowledge leakage meaningfully affects the validity of LLM backtesting, and simple prompt-based temporal constraints are insufficient to prevent it. A claim-level, Shapley-based analysis provides an interpretable metric of how much leaked information drives model decisions. The proposed TimeSPEC procedure can proactively filter temporal contamination, yielding predictions whose critical supporting claims are grounded in pre-cutoff evidence, thereby enabling more trustworthy retrospective evaluation of LLMs on forecasting-style tasks.

Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.

### [91] [Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Reusability and Verifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17544)
*Shashank Aggarwal,Ram Vikas Mishra,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose better ways to evaluate the quality of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multi-agent IR systems, beyond just task accuracy, using new metrics called reusability and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of CoT focus almost solely on end-task accuracy, which doesn’t capture whether the intermediate reasoning is actually useful or reliable, especially in multi-agent IR pipelines where multiple LLM agents must understand and build on each other’s CoTs.

Method: They introduce a Thinker-Executor framework that separates CoT generation (by the Thinker) from CoT execution (by the Executor). They define two metrics: (1) Reusability—how easily an Executor can use a Thinker’s CoT to solve the task; (2) Verifiability—how often an Executor can reproduce the Thinker’s answer using the CoT. They then systematically evaluate four Thinker models using a committee of ten Executor models over five benchmarks.

Result: They find that the new metrics (reusability and verifiability) do not correlate with standard accuracy, indicating that accuracy alone misses important aspects of reasoning quality. They also observe that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently better—i.e., more reusable or verifiable—than CoTs from general-purpose LLMs such as Llama and Gemma.

Conclusion: Accuracy-based leaderboards are insufficient to assess reasoning capabilities in multi-agent IR systems, because they ignore how usable and checkable the intermediate reasoning is. The proposed reusability and verifiability metrics, implemented via a Thinker-Executor setup, reveal that general-purpose LLMs can produce CoTs as or more practically valuable than those from specialized reasoning models.

Abstract: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.

### [92] [Web Verbs: Typed Abstractions for Reliable Task Composition on the Agentic Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17245)
*Linxi Jiang,Rui Xi,Zhijie Liu,Shuo Chen,Zhiqiang Lin,Suman Nath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Web Verbs, a semantic, typed function layer over the web that exposes site capabilities in a uniform way so LLM-based agents can build reliable, efficient, and auditable workflows instead of brittle click/keystroke scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based web agents operate on low-level browser actions (clicks, keystrokes, DOM interactions), which are brittle to UI changes, inefficient due to long action sequences, and hard to verify or audit. While there is progress on semantic layers for web content retrieval, there is no analogous semantic layer for actions. The authors want a principled, standardized way for agents to understand and invoke what a website can do, abstracted from its specific UI or whether access is via API or browser automation.

Method: Conceptual and system-design work: the authors introduce the abstraction of Web Verbs—a web-scale collection of typed, semantically documented functions that represent site capabilities. Each verb has a uniform interface and can include preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging hooks. They implement a proof-of-concept system that exposes site functionality via these verbs, then have LLMs synthesize small programs composed of verbs to achieve user goals. They compare the resulting workflows to existing agents that rely on low-level browser actions.

Result: The proof-of-concept and case studies show that workflows expressed in Web Verbs are more concise (many low-level steps compressed into a few function calls) and more robust, because verbs offer stable, semantically meaningful interfaces less sensitive to UI changes. Typed contracts and logging provide traceable, checkable execution, supporting verification and auditing. The approach successfully unifies API-based and browser-based interaction into a single abstraction that LLMs can reliably program against in the studied scenarios.

Conclusion: A semantic, typed action layer for the web—Web Verbs—can significantly improve reliability, efficiency, and verifiability of LLM-driven web agents by abstracting away low-level UI operations into stable, composable functions. This unifies disparate interaction paradigms (APIs vs. browser automation) and allows LLMs to synthesize clearer, auditable workflows. The authors advocate for standardizing such verbs so they can be widely deployed and trusted at web scale, and present their work as an initial step and design blueprint toward that goal.

Abstract: The Web is evolving from a medium that humans browse to an environment where software agents act on behalf of users. Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs. This abstraction unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, enabling LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow. Verbs can carry preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support, which improves \textbf{reliability} by providing stable interfaces, \textbf{efficiency} by reducing dozens of steps into a few function calls, and \textbf{verifiability} through typed contracts and checkable traces. We present our vision, a proof-of-concept implementation, and representative case studies that demonstrate concise and robust execution compared to existing agents. Finally, we outline a roadmap for standardization to make verbs deployable and trustworthy at web scale.

### [93] [KLong: Training LLM Agent for Extremely Long-horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17547)
*Yue Liu,Zhiyuan Hu,Flood Sung,Jiaheng Zhang,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KLong is an open-source long-context LLM agent trained with trajectory-splitting supervised fine-tuning and progressive reinforcement learning to solve extremely long-horizon tasks, outperforming much larger models on research and coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with extremely long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning, planning, and tool use over many steps. Moreover, training data and methods for such long trajectories are scarce and expensive, and standard SFT/RL techniques are not well-suited for very long contexts. The paper aims to build a smaller but more capable long-horizon agent and a scalable pipeline to generate and exploit long-horizon supervision.

Method: 1) Activate agentic abilities of a base model using a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) recipe. 2) Build Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that scrapes research papers and constructs evaluation rubrics to generate high-quality long-horizon trajectories, distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). 3) Propose trajectory-splitting SFT: preserve the early context of long trajectories while progressively truncating later parts and maintaining overlaps between sub-trajectories to make training feasible while retaining long-horizon structure. 4) Apply a novel progressive RL schedule: organize RL training into stages with gradually extended timeouts so the agent progressively learns to handle longer horizons.

Result: KLong (106B parameters) is trained using the proposed trajectory-splitting SFT and progressive RL with data from Research-Factory. It achieves strong performance on long-horizon evaluation benchmarks. Notably, on PaperBench it surpasses the much larger Kimi K2 Thinking (1T parameters) by 11.28%. The gains also transfer to other coding and practical benchmarks such as SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench, indicating good generalization of long-horizon capabilities.

Conclusion: The combination of trajectory-splitting supervised fine-tuning, progressive RL training with extended timeouts, and an automated data-generation pipeline (Research-Factory) enables effective training of a 106B-parameter LLM agent, KLong, that can solve extremely long-horizon tasks and outperform much larger state-of-the-art models on research and coding benchmarks. This suggests that careful data and training design tailored to long trajectories can be more important than sheer model size for long-horizon agent performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.

### [94] [CLEF HIPE-2026: Evaluating Accurate and Efficient Person-Place Relation Extraction from Multilingual Historical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17663)
*Juri Opitz,Corina Raclé,Emanuela Boros,Andrianos Michail,Matteo Romanello,Maud Ehrmann,Simon Clematide*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HIPE-2026 is an evaluation lab focused on extracting person–place relations from noisy, multilingual historical texts, assessing systems on accuracy, efficiency, and generalization to support digital humanities applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HIPE campaigns addressed named entity recognition in historical documents, but there is a growing need to move beyond entity identification to capturing semantic relations, especially person–place links that are crucial for historical research, biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis. Historical texts are noisy, multilingual, and span different time periods, making relation extraction challenging yet valuable for constructing knowledge graphs and processing large-scale historical data.

Method: The lab sets up a shared task where participating systems must automatically classify person–place relations of two types—“at” (the person has ever been at a given place) and “isAt” (the person is located at the place around the document’s publication time). This requires temporal and geographical reasoning over noisy, multilingual historical texts. HIPE-2026 defines a three-fold evaluation scheme, jointly measuring (1) extraction accuracy, (2) computational efficiency, and (3) domain generalization across languages and time periods.

Result: The abstract outlines the design and goals rather than reporting experimental outcomes. The main result at this stage is the specification of a new shared evaluation framework for person–place relation extraction, with clearly defined relation types, multilingual historical data, and an evaluation profile that balances correctness, efficiency, and robustness across domains.

Conclusion: HIPE-2026 extends prior HIPE initiatives from entity recognition to semantic relation extraction, specifically person–place associations, and introduces a comprehensive evaluation setup that encourages accurate, efficient, and generalizable systems. By doing so, it is positioned to advance tools and methods for large-scale historical text processing, thereby enabling richer knowledge-graph construction, biographical research, and spatial analyses within the digital humanities.

Abstract: HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ ("Has the person ever been at this place?") and $isAt$ ("Is the person located at this place around publication time?") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.

### [95] [MedClarify: An information-seeking AI agent for medical diagnosis with case-specific follow-up questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17308)
*Hui Min Wong,Philip Heesen,Pascal Janetzky,Martin Bendszus,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MedClarify, an AI agent that asks information-seeking follow-up questions to improve LLM-based medical diagnosis, reducing diagnostic errors by about 27 percentage points versus single-shot use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real clinical practice, diagnoses are rarely made from the initial presentation alone; clinicians iteratively collect information via targeted questions, reason over differential diagnoses, and rule out emergencies. Current medical LLMs usually operate in a single-shot fashion and struggle when patient cases are incomplete, producing several similarly likely diagnoses and failing to systematically reduce uncertainty. The authors aim to bridge this gap by enabling LLMs to emulate clinicians’ information-seeking behavior and uncertainty-aware reasoning.

Method: The authors design MedClarify, an AI agent that: (1) computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a clinician’s differential diagnosis; (2) uses an information-theoretic framework to generate and evaluate follow-up questions in terms of expected information gain about the correct diagnosis; and (3) selects and poses the single question that maximally reduces diagnostic uncertainty. They then empirically compare MedClarify to standard single-shot LLM baselines on diagnostic tasks, especially in settings with incomplete or missing case information.

Result: Experiments show that standard LLMs frequently output several diagnoses with similar likelihood, particularly when cases lack key information, highlighting the deficiency of single-shot diagnostic reasoning. MedClarify’s information-seeking framework generates effective, targeted follow-up questions and achieves about a 27 percentage-point reduction in diagnostic errors relative to a single-shot LLM baseline, with statistical significance (p.p. improvement reported).

Conclusion: MedClarify demonstrates that explicitly modeling uncertainty and using information-seeking follow-up questions can substantially improve LLM-based diagnostic performance. The work suggests a path toward more clinically realistic, dialogue-based medical AI systems that mirror human clinicians’ iterative reasoning, prioritize ruling out emergencies, and better handle incomplete patient information through agentic, uncertainty-aware question asking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for diagnostic tasks in medicine. In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.

### [96] [Dataless Weight Disentanglement in Task Arithmetic via Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17385)
*Angelo Porrello,Pietro Buzzega,Felix Dangel,Thomas Sommariva,Riccardo Salami,Lorenzo Bonicelli,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose a dataless regularization method to prevent representation drift when combining task vectors for task arithmetic in foundation models, achieving robust, scalable, state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task arithmetic offers a modular and scalable way to adapt large foundation models via task vectors, but combining multiple tasks can cause cross-task interference and representation drift, degrading performance. Existing methods that regularize this drift usually require external task data, which breaks modularity and may violate data availability or privacy constraints. A method that can control drift without relying on task data is needed.

Method: They reframe representation drift regularization as a curvature matrix approximation problem. Leveraging established second-order approximation techniques, they use Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) to construct a practical dataless regularizer. This regularizer constrains updates when adding or negating task vectors, and is designed to have constant complexity with respect to the number of tasks while being robust to rescaling of task vectors.

Result: The proposed K-FAC-based dataless regularizer achieves state-of-the-art performance in typical task arithmetic operations, such as task addition and task negation, when adapting foundation models. It also removes the need for held-out tuning by ensuring robustness to task vector scaling and maintains good performance across multiple tasks without growing computational cost with the number of tasks.

Conclusion: By treating representation drift control as a curvature approximation problem and applying K-FAC, they introduce a dataless regularization method that keeps task arithmetic modular, scalable, and privacy-friendly. The approach effectively mitigates cross-task interference, achieves state-of-the-art results on task combination operations, and scales with constant complexity in the number of tasks while avoiding extra tuning for task vector scaling.

Abstract: Task Arithmetic yields a modular, scalable way to adapt foundation models. Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.

### [97] [Visual Model Checking: Graph-Based Inference of Visual Routines for Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17386)
*Adrià Molina,Oriol Ramos Terrades,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose an image retrieval framework that combines neural models with formal verification so that complex natural language queries can be answered in a trustworthy, constraint-aware, and explainable way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embedding-based and pretrained models for natural language image search struggle with queries requiring complex relationships, compositions, and strict constraints (identities, counts, proportions). These systems are approximate and opaque: they can retrieve plausible-looking images but cannot guarantee that each part of a complex query is truly satisfied or explain which constraints failed. There is a need for retrieval that is both open-vocabulary and formally trustworthy, providing explicit reasoning about query satisfaction.

Method: They design a framework that integrates formal verification techniques into deep learning-based image retrieval. The key ingredients are: (1) a graph-based verification component that represents the atomic facts and relationships implied by a natural language query; (2) neural code generation that translates the query into a formal, verifiable specification; and (3) a verification process that checks each atomic truth (constraints, relations, compositions) against the content of candidate images. The system works with open-vocabulary natural language, uses existing embedding-based retrieval to propose candidates, and then applies the formal reasoning layer to verify which constraints hold.

Result: The framework enables image retrieval that not only returns images matching a natural language query but also provides, for each result, a fine-grained assessment of which constraints in the query are satisfied or violated. This improves the reliability and interpretability of retrieval, and can be used to enhance the performance of popular embedding-based approaches by filtering or re-ranking their outputs using formal verification.

Conclusion: By grounding image retrieval in a formal reasoning layer integrated with neural methods, the proposed framework addresses limitations of purely embedding-based systems on complex, constraint-heavy queries. It supports open-vocabulary natural language input while offering verifiable, transparent results, marking satisfied and unmet constraints. This leads to more accountable and trustworthy retrieval, representing a step beyond the inherent ambiguity and approximation of vector-based representations.

Abstract: Information retrieval lies at the foundation of the modern digital industry. While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.

### [98] [A Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder for NSCLC Survival Prediction with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17402)
*Michele Zanitti,Vanja Miskovic,Francesco Trovò,Alessandra Laura Giulia Pedrocchi,Ming Shen,Yan Kyaw Tun,Arsela Prelaj,Sokol Kosta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCVAE, a multimodal deep learning model that robustly predicts NSCLC survival using incomplete combinations of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survival prediction in NSCLC is difficult because each patient has heterogeneous prognostic factors and clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire data modalities missing for many patients. Existing multimodal models either ignore missing modalities or try to generate them, but they degrade badly when missingness is severe. There is a need for a method that can effectively integrate multiple omics and imaging data while remaining robust to arbitrary, high levels of missing modalities.

Method: The authors propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE). Each modality (WSI, transcriptomics, methylation) has its own variational encoder to model its uncertainty and produce latent representations. These are combined via a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms that adaptively weight the contribution of each available modality. Training uses a multi-task objective: (1) a survival prediction loss, (2) reconstruction losses for each modality to regularize the patient latent representation, and (3) a cross-modal contrastive loss to align representations from different modalities in a shared latent space. Stochastic modality masking during training simulates missing modalities, improving robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns.

Result: On TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446), MCVAE achieves better disease-specific survival prediction performance and greater robustness under severe missing-modality scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art multimodal models. Experiments that evaluate all modality subsets show how performance changes when adding or removing particular modalities, revealing that multimodal integration is sometimes neutral or even detrimental depending on the task-modality combination.

Conclusion: MCVAE provides a robust framework for integrating heterogeneous clinical, imaging, and molecular data for NSCLC survival prediction, especially in settings with extensive missing modalities. Its combination of variational encoders, gated fusion, reconstruction and contrastive objectives, and stochastic masking leads to improved survival prediction and resilience to missing data. The analysis of different modality subsets further suggests that multimodal integration should be applied selectively, as adding more modalities does not universally improve performance.

Abstract: Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task.

### [99] [A Privacy by Design Framework for Large Language Model-Based Applications for Children](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17418)
*Diana Addae,Diana Rogachova,Nafiseh Kahani,Masoud Barati,Michael Christensen,Chen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a practical Privacy-by-Design framework for AI systems used by children, especially LLM-based apps, aligning legal requirements and technical controls across the model lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children increasingly interact with AI technologies, raising serious privacy concerns. Although laws like GDPR, PIPEDA, and COPPA mandate protections, developers struggle to operationalize these in real-world AI systems, particularly those powered by LLMs. There is a need for a concrete, lifecycle-oriented framework that translates regulatory and child-rights principles into actionable design and engineering practices.

Method: The authors synthesize privacy principles from multiple regulations (GDPR, PIPEDA, COPPA) and child-focused guidelines (UNCRC, AADC) and organize them along the LLM lifecycle: data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, they review and map relevant technical and organizational controls from recent academic work and derive design guidelines tailored to children. They then apply this framework to a concrete case study: an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13, analyzing how the proposed controls and guidelines would work in practice.

Result: The paper yields: (1) a unified PbD-based framework that connects regulatory principles, child-rights instruments, and technical controls to each key stage of LLM-based application development and operation; (2) a catalog of operational controls from recent research that can reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards; and (3) a detailed case study showing how these elements can be instantiated in an LLM tutor for children under 13.

Conclusion: By systematically applying Privacy-by-Design principles, regulatory requirements, and age-appropriate design guidance across the entire LLM lifecycle, AI providers can substantially reduce privacy risks for children and better comply with legal obligations. The case study suggests that combining technical and organizational data protection strategies with child-centered design leads to more privacy-preserving AI applications for young users.

Abstract: Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.

TL;DR: WarpRec is a unified, high-performance recommender-systems framework that runs both locally and in distributed environments, includes many algorithms/metrics, tracks energy use, and is designed to be future-proof for agentic AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender-systems research is split between simple in-memory academic prototypes and complex, production-grade distributed engines, making it hard to transfer innovations between academia and industry and to experiment at scale in a reproducible, sustainable way.

Method: Design and implementation of WarpRec, a backend-agnostic architecture that can switch seamlessly between local and distributed execution; integration of 50+ algorithms, 40 evaluation metrics, and 19 filtering/splitting strategies; embedding of CodeCarbon for real-time energy-consumption tracking; and architectural provisions to support future agentic/interactive recommender use cases.

Result: WarpRec provides a working framework that supports scalable training and optimization of many recommender algorithms with consistent APIs across backends, while offering built-in experimentation tools and energy tracking. It demonstrates that researchers can achieve both scalability and ecological awareness without rewriting systems for different environments.

Conclusion: WarpRec successfully bridges the gap between academic and industrial recommender-system workflows, offering a unified, sustainable, and agent-ready infrastructure that can serve as a foundation for the next generation of recommender systems research and applications.

Abstract: Innovation in Recommender Systems is currently impeded by a fractured ecosystem, where researchers must choose between the ease of in-memory experimentation and the costly, complex rewriting required for distributed industrial engines. To bridge this gap, we present WarpRec, a high-performance framework that eliminates this trade-off through a novel, backend-agnostic architecture. It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem. In summary, WarpRec not only bridges the gap between academia and industry but also can serve as the architectural backbone for the next generation of sustainable, agent-ready Recommender Systems.

*Pranay Jain,Maximilian Kasper,Göran Köber,Axel Plinge,Dominik Seuß*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmarking framework evaluates AI models on ARM Cortex M0+/M4/M7 processors regarding energy, accuracy, and resources, revealing FLOPs–time correlation and processor-specific trade-offs to guide energy-efficient embedded AI design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedded AI on microcontrollers must balance accuracy, energy consumption, and limited compute/memory resources, but developers lack a systematic way to compare AI models across different ARM Cortex processors and select the best processor–model pairing for a given use case.

Method: Design an automated benchmarking test bench that runs various AI models on ARM Cortex M0+, M4, and M7 processors. Measure KPIs such as inference time, energy consumption, and resource utilization. Analyze the correlation between FLOPs and inference time, and apply Pareto analysis to explore trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy for different processor–model combinations.

Result: The study finds a near-linear correlation between FLOPs and inference time, validating FLOPs as a practical proxy for computational cost. Pareto fronts identify optimal trade-offs between energy and accuracy. Empirically, the M7 excels in short, high-performance inference cycles; the M4 is more energy-efficient for longer inference workloads; and the M0+ is only suitable for simpler, less demanding AI tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework gives developers a practical way to benchmark and select AI models and ARM Cortex processors according to energy, accuracy, and resource constraints. FLOPs can be used to estimate inference time reliably, and Pareto analysis enables principled trade-off decisions. These insights help design energy-efficient, high-performance embedded AI systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications.

*Dun Yuan,Hao Zhou,Xue Liu,Hao Chen,Yan Xin,Jianzhong,Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-RAG integrates knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation to make LLMs more accurate and reliable for telecom tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs perform poorly in telecom due to complex standards, rapidly evolving specifications, and heavy jargon, which cause hallucinations and non-compliant answers. There is a need for a domain-grounded approach that can reliably follow telecom standards while leveraging LLM capabilities.

Method: The authors construct a telecom knowledge graph from standards and technical documents to encode entities, relations, and constraints in the domain. They then design a KG-RAG framework where user queries trigger retrieval over both unstructured documents and the KG. Retrieved structured facts and contextual documents are injected into the LLM’s prompt so that generation is grounded in the KG and relevant texts, enabling better reasoning and compliance with telecom rules.

Result: On multiple telecom-related benchmark datasets, KG-RAG surpasses both plain LLMs and standard text-only RAG systems. The abstract reports average accuracy gains of about 14.3% over standard RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only baselines, indicating substantial improvements in correctness and reduction of hallucinations.

Conclusion: Combining knowledge graphs with RAG significantly enhances LLM performance on complex telecom tasks, yielding more accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs that align with telecom standards. KG-RAG is presented as a promising architecture for deploying LLMs in specialized, standards-driven industrial domains like telecommunications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.

### [103] [ODESteer: A Unified ODE-Based Steering Framework for LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17560)
*Hongjue Zhao,Haosen Sun,Jiangtao Kong,Xiaochang Li,Qineng Wang,Liwei Jiang,Qi Zhu,Tarek Abdelzaher,Yejin Choi,Manling Li,Huajie Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ODESteer, an ODE-based method to steer internal activations of LLMs for alignment, providing a unified theoretical framework and showing empirical gains on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods for aligning LLMs lack a clear unified theory and typically use one-step, linear activation edits that cannot model complex activation dynamics. The authors aim to ground steering in a principled framework and design more powerful, adaptive, multi-step steering procedures.

Method: They reinterpret activation addition as a first-order approximation of solving an ODE over activations. Using control theory, they cast finding steering directions as designing a barrier function. They propose ODESteer, which defines the barrier as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and constructs an ODE that is integrated in multiple adaptive steps along the forward pass to steer activations.

Result: ODESteer delivers consistent improvements in alignment metrics compared with state-of-the-art activation steering baselines, including about 5.7% on TruthfulQA, 2.5% on UltraFeedback, and 2.4% on RealToxicityPrompts, showing that the ODE-based, multi-step steering is empirically effective.

Conclusion: Activation steering can be systematically understood through an ODE-based lens, where steering corresponds to integrating an ODE defined via a barrier function. The proposed ODESteer method both unifies the theory of steering and achieves better empirical alignment performance, suggesting that ODE-based, multi-step, adaptive steering is a promising direction for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.

### [104] [A Hybrid Federated Learning Based Ensemble Approach for Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging Fusion of SWIN Transformer and CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17566)
*Asif Hasan Chowdhury,Md. Fahim Islam,M Ragib Anjum Riad,Faiyaz Bin Hashem,Md Tanzim Reza,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated-learning-based hybrid ensemble model that combines SWIN Transformer and several CNN architectures to diagnose COVID-19 and pneumonia from chest X-rays in a secure, distributed way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing computational capabilities and AI progress enable advanced medical image analysis, but data sharing across hospitals is limited by privacy and security concerns. There is a need for accurate, robust lung disease diagnosis systems that can learn from multi-institutional data without centralizing sensitive medical records, particularly for COVID-19 and pneumonia detection.

Method: Design a hybrid ensemble model that integrates state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG19) with a transformer-based vision architecture (SWIN Transformer). Train and update this model using federated learning so that hospitals share model parameters/gradients instead of raw data. Implement continual (real-time) learning so the global model is periodically updated as new X-ray data arrives from different sites. Use TensorFlow, Keras, and Microsoft’s SWIN Transformer implementation for development, and apply the model to chest X-ray images for multi-class classification of lung conditions (COVID-19, pneumonia, presumably healthy).

Result: The abstract claims that the hybrid federated-learning model can improve the accuracy of lung disease diagnosis and severity prediction relative to using individual models alone, while also providing enhanced security and data authenticity via federated learning. However, specific quantitative metrics, datasets, and baselines are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: A federated-learning-enabled hybrid ensemble combining CNNs and SWIN Transformer is presented as a promising, secure, and distributed solution for automated diagnosis of COVID-19 and pneumonia from chest X-rays. The authors conclude that such a system can support physicians by improving diagnostic accuracy and severity prediction while preserving data privacy and security across collaborating hospitals.

Abstract: The significant advancements in computational power cre- ate a vast opportunity for using Artificial Intelligence in different ap- plications of healthcare and medical science. A Hybrid FL-Enabled Ensemble Approach For Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging a Combination of SWIN Transformer and CNN is the combination of cutting-edge technology of AI and Federated Learning. Since, medi- cal specialists and hospitals will have shared data space, based on that data, with the help of Artificial Intelligence and integration of federated learning, we can introduce a secure and distributed system for medical data processing and create an efficient and reliable system. The proposed hybrid model enables the detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia based on x-ray reports. We will use advanced and the latest available tech- nology offered by Tensorflow and Keras along with Microsoft-developed Vision Transformer, that can help to fight against the pandemic that the world has to fight together as a united. We focused on using the latest available CNN models (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG 19) and the Transformer model SWIN Transformer in order to prepare our hy- brid model that can provide a reliable solution as a helping hand for the physician in the medical field. In this research, we will discuss how the Federated learning-based Hybrid AI model can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity prediction of a patient using the real-time continual learning approach and how the integration of federated learn- ing can ensure hybrid model security and keep the authenticity of the information.

### [105] [AI Gamestore: Scalable, Open-Ended Evaluation of Machine General Intelligence with Human Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17594)
*Lance Ying,Ryan Truong,Prafull Sharma,Kaiya Ivy Zhao,Nathan Cloos,Kelsey R. Allen,Thomas L. Griffiths,Katherine M. Collins,José Hernández-Orallo,Phillip Isola,Samuel J. Gershman,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluating AI general intelligence by how well systems can learn and play a very broad range of human-designed games, and presents AI GameStore, a platform that automatically generates such games and benchmarks current models, finding they perform far below humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks test narrow, static skills and quickly saturate as models are tuned for them, making it hard to assess genuine human-like general intelligence. The authors seek a more comprehensive, dynamic, and scalable way to evaluate AI by leveraging the diversity of human-created games.

Method: They conceptualize the "Multiverse of Human Games" as the space of all games designed by humans for humans, and argue for its suitability as an evaluation domain. Concretely, they build AI GameStore, a scalable platform that uses large language models plus humans-in-the-loop to automatically source, adapt, and containerize game environments from popular digital platforms (e.g., Apple App Store and Steam). They then generate 100 such games and benchmark seven frontier vision-language models on short play episodes, comparing their performance to human players with similar resource constraints.

Result: From the 100 generated games, seven state-of-the-art vision-language models achieved less than 10% of the average human score on most games. Their weaknesses were particularly pronounced in games requiring strong world-model learning, memory, and planning capabilities.

Conclusion: The results indicate that current frontier models are far from human-level general intelligence when evaluated across a diverse set of human games. The AI GameStore represents a promising, open-ended framework for generating and curating such games, and the authors propose it as a practical path to both measure and spur progress toward human-like general intelligence in AI systems.

Abstract: Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.

### [106] [MolHIT: Advancing Molecular-Graph Generation with Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17602)
*Hojung Jung,Rodrigo Hormazabal,Jaehyeong Jo,Youngrok Park,Kyunggeun Roh,Se-Young Yun,Sehui Han,Dae-Woong Jeong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolHIT is a new hierarchical discrete graph diffusion model that generates molecular graphs with near-perfect chemical validity and state-of-the-art performance on MOSES, while also supporting property-conditioned design and scaffold extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular diffusion models on 2D graphs suffer from low chemical validity and have difficulty matching the property-focused performance of 1D (string-based) models. There is a need for a graph-based generator that preserves chemical correctness, leverages chemical priors, and competes or surpasses 1D models on standard benchmarks and downstream drug discovery tasks.

Method: The authors propose MolHIT, built on a Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model that extends traditional discrete diffusion to handle additional categorical variables encoding chemical prior knowledge. They also introduce a decoupled atom encoding scheme, where atom types are split according to their distinct chemical roles, enabling more structured and chemically aware diffusion over molecular graphs.

Result: On the MOSES benchmark, MolHIT attains new state-of-the-art results among graph diffusion models, achieving near-perfect chemical validity for the first time in this class. It also outperforms strong 1D generative baselines on multiple evaluation metrics and shows robust performance on downstream tasks like multi-property guided molecular generation and scaffold extension.

Conclusion: MolHIT resolves key limitations of prior graph diffusion generators by integrating hierarchical discrete diffusion with chemically informed encodings, yielding highly valid and high-quality molecular graphs. Its superior benchmark performance and strong results on property-controlled generation and scaffold extension indicate that it is a powerful and practical framework for AI-driven molecular design.

Abstract: Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.

### [107] [AutoNumerics: An Autonomous, PDE-Agnostic Multi-Agent Pipeline for Scientific Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17607)
*Jianda Du,Youran Sun,Haizhao Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoNumerics is a multi-agent, LLM-driven system that automatically designs transparent, classical numerical solvers for PDEs from natural language, achieving accuracy competitive with neural/LLM baselines on diverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing high-quality numerical solvers for PDEs requires deep expertise in numerical analysis and substantial manual effort. While neural network-based PDE solvers can be more flexible, they are computationally heavy, less interpretable, and often act as black boxes. There is a need for an automated, accessible approach that can turn informal PDE problem descriptions into reliable, interpretable solvers grounded in classical methods.

Method: The paper proposes AutoNumerics, a multi-agent framework (likely based on large language models) that takes natural language descriptions of PDE problems and autonomously: (1) selects appropriate numerical schemes; (2) designs and implements solver code; (3) debugs the implementation; and (4) verifies correctness. Key technical components include: (a) a coarse-to-fine execution strategy, where the system first drafts a high-level solution plan and then refines it into detailed algorithms and code; and (b) a residual-based self-verification mechanism that evaluates numerical residuals to detect and correct solver errors or mis-specifications. The system focuses on generating classical, interpretable numerical schemes rather than black-box neural solvers.

Result: On 24 canonical and real-world PDE benchmarks, AutoNumerics produces numerical solvers whose accuracy is competitive with or better than state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers and prior LLM-based automatic solver frameworks. The system automatically selects numerical methods consistent with the structural properties of the PDEs (e.g., stability, stiffness, boundary conditions), indicating that it is not merely pattern-matching but capturing relevant numerical-analysis principles.

Conclusion: AutoNumerics demonstrates that multi-agent, LLM-based systems can autonomously construct transparent, classical PDE solvers directly from natural language problem descriptions, while maintaining competitive accuracy with specialized neural and LLM baselines. This suggests a promising, accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving that reduces the need for deep numerical-analysis expertise and extensive manual implementation, while preserving interpretability and principled method selection.

Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.
