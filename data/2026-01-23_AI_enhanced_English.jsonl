We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%.

However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling. And they produce abstract topics, requiring extensive human interpretation. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework (MALTopic). This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data.", "AI": {"tldr": "A multi-agent LLM-based framework (MALTopic) for survey topic modeling that enriches answers with structured data and yields more coherent, diverse, and interpretable topics than LDA/BERTopic.", "motivation": "Existing topic modeling for surveys mostly relies only on free-text responses and ignores associated structured or categorical data.

Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation.

Visual fidelity is at most an auxiliary property, not a core objective. Evaluation and design should focus on structured 4D representations, adherence to domain invariants, and performance on counterfactual and intervention-heavy tasks, as illustrated by the stringent requirements of medical decision-making."}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary.

Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent).

We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases.

Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity.

We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey.

We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time.

First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs.

Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances.

This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a system that detects climate-related visual disinformation by augmenting vision-language models with up-to-date external knowledge sources.", "motivation": "Climate disinformation, especially misleading images and videos on social media, undermines timely action on climate change. Existing vision-language models used to detect visual disinformation are constrained by the static knowledge captured at training time, making them weak at handling recent events and newly emerging misleading content. There is a need for systems that can reason about and verify visual climate claims using current, trustworthy information.", "method": "The paper combines a pre-trained vision-language model with external knowledge retrieval. Given an image and its associated claim, the system queries various up-to-date sources such as reverse image search results, online fact-checking articles, and trusted expert or institutional content. It then uses this retrieved evidence together with the VLM\u2019s internal representations to classify the pair as accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. The core method is thus a retrieval-augmented VLM for multimodal climate fact-checking.", "result": "Using the external knowledge-augmented approach, the system is better able to evaluate climate-related image-claim pairs than a baseline VLM that relies only on its frozen, training-time knowledge. It more accurately distinguishes between true, misleading, false, and unverifiable content, particularly for recent events and evolving climate narratives.", "conclusion": "Incorporating live, trustworthy external knowledge into vision-language models significantly improves the detection of climate visual disinformation. This retrieval-augmented strategy addresses the limitation of static model knowledge, making automated systems more effective for real-world, time-sensitive climate fact-checking and helping to safeguard public understanding of climate science in a rapidly changing information ecosystem."}}

We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-in-Sandbox, in both training-free and post-trained settings, achieves robust generalization spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following. Finally, we analyze LLM-in-Sandbox's efficiency from computational and system perspectives, and open-source it as a Python package to facilitate real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM-in-Sandbox lets language models use a controlled code-execution environment as a general-purpose tool, improving their performance and generalization on many non-coding tasks.", "motivation": "Standard LLMs are limited by context length, lack of persistent memory, and restricted access to external tools or resources. While code sandboxes are typically used for programming tasks, the authors suspect that a sandbox\u2014seen as a virtual computer\u2014could enable broader, more agentic behavior even in non-code domains, without retraining the LLM on explicit agentic data. They aim to explore whether and how LLMs can spontaneously exploit such an environment to gain capabilities like tool use, long-context handling, and knowledge acquisition, and how to systematically improve these behaviors.", "method": "They introduce LLM-in-Sandbox, where an LLM can interact with a code sandbox: running scripts, accessing a file system, and calling external resources. First, they study zero-training behavior of strong LLMs in this setup on non-code tasks, observing emergent tool use. Then, they propose LLM-in-Sandbox-RL, a reinforcement learning approach that improves sandbox exploration and use, trained only on non-agentic data. They evaluate both training-free and post-trained models across multiple domains\u2014mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context tasks, and instruction following\u2014and perform computational and systems-level efficiency analysis. They release the system as a Python package.", "result": "The experiments show that even without additional training, strong LLMs can leverage the sandbox for non-code tasks: they query external tools/resources, use the file system for extended context, and run scripts to meet special formatting constraints. With LLM-in-Sandbox-RL, these behaviors become more competent and reliable. Across diverse benchmarks, the sandbox-enabled setups achieve strong and robust generalization and performance improvements in scientific reasoning, long-context understanding, and following complex instructions. Efficiency studies characterize the computational and system overheads of using the sandbox.", "conclusion": "A code sandbox environment, treated as a virtual computer, can effectively elicit more general and agentic intelligence from LLMs far beyond coding. LLMs can spontaneously exploit such tools, and reinforcement learning further enhances this ability using only non-agentic data. LLM-in-Sandbox provides a practical, open-source framework for deploying LLMs with improved reasoning, memory, and tool-usage capabilities across multiple domains, while allowing engineers to reason about efficiency and system trade-offs."}}

This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons.
