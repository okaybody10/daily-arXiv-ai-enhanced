AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which \"general intelligence\" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper argues that AI progress is nonlinear and introduces the ideas of \u201cfamiliar\u201d vs. \u201cstrange\u201d intelligence to explain why powerful AIs can still make obvious mistakes.", "motivation": "Linear, one-dimensional views of intelligence (e.g., a single IQ-like scale) badly fit the way current and future AI systems actually behave, and this misfit can mislead evaluation and safety expectations.

Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated.

This loses important priors about where relevant information is likely to be and how it is organized, making multi-step question answering over long PDFs less efficient and less accurate. The authors want a system that can reason over long documents more like humans do, by first locating promising regions using structural cues and then reading them in order.", "method": "They propose DeepRead, a document reasoning agent that is explicitly structure-aware. First, a LLM-based OCR pipeline converts PDFs into structured Markdown, preserving headings and paragraph boundaries. The document is indexed at paragraph level, and each paragraph is tagged with a coordinate-style metadata key representing its section identity and position within that section. At inference time, an LLM agent uses two tools built on this representation: (1) a Retrieve tool that finds relevant paragraphs and exposes their structural coordinates plus brief scanning context, and (2) a ReadSection tool that allows contiguous, order-preserving reading within a chosen section and paragraph span. The agent operates in a multi-turn fashion, iteratively deciding when to retrieve, when to read sections, and when to reason/answer.", "result": "In experiments on long-document question answering, DeepRead significantly outperforms Search-o1-style agentic search baselines that rely on flat chunk retrieval. Ablation and behavioral analyses show that the combination of the Retrieve and ReadSection tools yields synergistic gains beyond either capability alone.

By representing documents at the paragraph level with structural coordinates and equipping an LLM agent with complementary retrieval and section-reading tools, DeepRead enables more human-like, efficient, and accurate multi-turn reasoning than flat-chunk baselines.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation.

MINT uses these estimates to evaluate the value of potential queries to the human, effectively selecting those that are most informative for improving downstream planning. Large language models (LLMs) are then used to search and summarize MINT\u2019s internal reasoning and synthesize a compact set of natural-language questions to present to the human. The approach includes an analysis of return guarantees when planning with active human elicitation under the extended MDP framework.", "result": "Across three benchmarks that involve previously unseen or unknown objects and progressively more realistic settings, MINT-based planning achieves performance close to that of expert planners. It requires only a small number of human-directed questions per task, yet yields significantly higher rewards and success rates than baselines that either ask no questions or ask less strategically.", "conclusion": "MINT provides an effective neuro-symbolic framework for active human information elicitation in joint planning. By explicitly modeling knowledge gaps, quantifying their impact on planning outcomes, and using LLMs to convert internal reasoning into focused natural-language queries, the method enables AI agents to reach near-expert performance with minimal human interaction.

This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting \"interactivity\" of actions.

Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality.

In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \\emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \\emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning.

However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs.

Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.\n  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts.

To address this, we introduce the \"Autoregressive Blindness Bound,\" a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts.

In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation.

Each path is constructed to correct the quantization error left by the previous path, ensuring complementary rather than redundant representations.

Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings.

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming.

Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings.

To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines.

The extracted metrics differentiate between clinical groups and concept types, suggesting that the geometric and dynamical properties of trajectories contain diagnostically and theoretically meaningful information.

Results are consistent across different transformer models, indicating that despite differences in training setups, these models induce similar semantic geometries for the purposes of this analysis.", "conclusion": "Semantic navigation in humans can be productively modeled as structured trajectories through transformer-based embedding spaces. This geometric-dynamical framework bridges cognitive modeling and modern representation learning, enabling minimally supervised, language-flexible quantification of semantic search processes. It provides a scalable alternative to manual linguistic coding, with promising applications in clinical assessment (e.g., neurodegenerative conditions), cross-linguistic studies, and the evaluation of artificial cognitive systems. The similarity of results across embedding models suggests a degree of convergence in learned semantic structures, reinforcing the viability of this approach as a general tool for studying semantic representation dynamics."}}

Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFlash is a speculative decoding framework that uses a lightweight block diffusion model to draft multiple tokens in parallel for large language models, achieving significantly faster, lossless inference than prior speculative methods.", "motivation": "Autoregressive LLMs decode tokens sequentially, causing high latency and inefficient GPU usage. Speculative decoding helps by using a draft model, but current approaches still draft autoregressively, preserving much of the sequential bottleneck. Diffusion LLMs allow parallel generation but generally lag behind autoregressive models in quality. The paper aims to remove the sequential drafting bottleneck while maintaining or improving output quality and speedup.", "method": "The authors propose DFlash, which replaces autoregressive drafting with a lightweight block diffusion model capable of generating multiple draft tokens in one parallel forward pass. This draft model is conditioned on context features extracted from the target autoregressive LLM to better align its drafts with the target\u2019s predictions, thereby increasing the rate at which drafted tokens are accepted during verification. The overall framework integrates this diffusion-based drafter with standard speculative decoding, where the target model verifies and possibly corrects the drafts in parallel.", "result": "Experiments across various models and tasks show that DFlash provides over 6x lossless acceleration of inference compared to standard autoregressive decoding. Relative to the state-of-the-art speculative decoding approach EAGLE-3, DFlash achieves up to 2.5x higher speedups, indicating that parallel block diffusion drafting substantially improves practical performance and acceptance rates without sacrificing accuracy.", "conclusion": "DFlash demonstrates that a lightweight, context-conditioned block diffusion model can serve as an effective parallel drafter for speculative decoding, overcoming the sequential limitations of autoregressive drafting. The framework delivers large, lossless speedups over both vanilla autoregressive decoding and prior speculative methods, suggesting that diffusion-style parallel generation can be successfully integrated with strong autoregressive LLMs to improve inference efficiency."}}

We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \\key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges.

These do not adapt to the changing information needs at different stages of problem solving, which can lead to redundant communication, poor coordination, and suboptimal performance. The authors aim to create a more flexible and efficient communication mechanism that changes over time and is better aligned with what each agent needs at each round.", "method": "They propose DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework. At each reasoning round, a manager defines a round-specific goal. Conditioned on this goal, each agent produces two short natural-language descriptors: a query (\"need\") describing what information it seeks, and a key (\"offer\") describing what information it can provide. These descriptors are embedded into a vector space, and semantic similarity is used to match needs to offers, inducing a sparse directed communication graph. Private messages are routed only along edges defined by these matches. This dynamic topology reconstruction is repeated each round, yielding evolving communication structures across the reasoning trajectory.", "result": "On code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and across four different LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently surpasses the strongest baseline system by an average margin of 6.2 points (the exact metric is not specified in the abstract, but presumably task accuracy or a similar benchmark score).", "conclusion": "Dynamically reconstructing a sparse communication graph based on agents\u2019 context-dependent needs and offers leads to better multi-round reasoning performance than fixed communication topologies. DyTopo not only improves accuracy but also produces interpretable coordination traces, as the evolving communication graphs reveal how information pathways and collaboration patterns change over the course of problem solving."}}
