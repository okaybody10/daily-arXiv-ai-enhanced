This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Bl\u00f6baum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor. Based on these insights, we propose practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \ud658\uac01(hallucination)\uc774

First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists.

Built around a standardized \\texttt{Dialog} representation, SDialog provides: (1) persona-driven multi-agent simulation with composable orchestration for controlled, synthetic dialog generation, (2) comprehensive evaluation combining linguistic metrics, LLM-as-a-judge and functional correctness validators, (3) mechanistic interpretability tools for activation inspection and steering via feature ablation and induction, and (4) audio generation with full acoustic simulation including 3D room modeling and microphone effects. The toolkit integrates with all major LLM backends, enabling mixed-backend experiments under a unified API.

However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc694\uc57d\ud574 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc555\ucd95\uae30(compressor)\uac00 \ub178\uc774\uc988(\ubb34\uad00\u00b7\uc624\ub958 \uc815\ubcf4)\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 ACoRN\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RAG \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \ubb38\uc11c \uc548\uc5d0 \uc9c8\ubb38\uacfc \ubb34\uad00\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc774 \uc11e\uc5ec \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc555\ucd95\uae30\ub294 \uc774\ub7f0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc744 \ub54c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uadfc\uac70\ub97c \ube60\ub728\ub9ac\uac70\ub098 \uc624\ub2f5\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uace0, \uae34 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc758(attention)\uac00 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uace0 \uc704\uce58 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub3c4 \uc874\uc7ac\ud574 \ud575\uc2ec \uadfc\uac70\ub97c \uc798 \ubabb \uc0b4\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ub2f5\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc555\ucd95\uae30\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "1) \uac80\uc0c9 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc11e\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc555\ucd95\uae30\uac00 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uacac\ub514\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. 2) \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc704\uce58 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 LM \uae30\ubc18 \uc555\ucd95\uae30\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc815\ub2f5\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc911\uc2ec(summary centered around key information)\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815(finetuning)\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\ud604\uc740 T5-large\ub97c \uc555\ucd95\uae30\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc774 ACoRN \uc808\ucc28\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "ACoRN \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c T5-large \uc555\ucd95\uae30\ub97c RAG \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ub123\uc5c8\uc744 \ub54c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c EM\uacfc F1\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc815\ub2f5 \ubb38\uc790\uc5f4 \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \uc694\uc57d \uc548\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc728\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc84c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub5a8\uc5b4\ub728\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc11c(\ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubb38\uc11c)\uac00 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc11e\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc774\ub4dd\uc774 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc84c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c ACoRN \ud559\uc2b5 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc555\ucd95\uae30\uac00 \ud575\uc2ec \uadfc\uac70\uc640 \uc815\ub2f5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration.

This work confronts this challenge by introducing a targeted RL framework designed to mitigate both intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations across short and long-form question answering. We address extrinsic hallucinations (flawed internal knowledge) by creating a novel training set from open-ended conversions of TriviaQA. Concurrently, we tackle intrinsic hallucinations (unfaithfulness to context) by leveraging long-form texts from FineWeb in a fact-grounding reward scheme. To further bolster reliability, our framework explicitly rewards the model for refusing to answer unanswerable questions, thereby cultivating crucial cautiousness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methodology yields significant performance gains across a diverse suite of benchmarks, substantially reducing both hallucination types. Ultimately, this research contributes a practical framework for resolving the critical tension between advanced reasoning and factual trustworthiness, paving the way for more capable and reliable

We define agentic systems as goal-directed, tool-using decision makers operating in closed loops, and show how reliability emerges from principled componentisation (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control and assurance loops. Building on classical foundations, we propose a practical taxonomy-tool-using agents, memory-augmented agents, planning and self-improvement agents, multi-agent systems, and embodied or web agents - and analyse how each pattern reshapes the reliability envelope and failure modes. We distil design guidance on typed schemas, idempotency, permissioning, transactional semantics, memory provenance and hygiene, runtime governance (budgets, termination conditions), and simulate-before-actuate safeguards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc7a5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615/\uc0dd\uc131 AI\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \u2018\uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc124\uacc4\u2019\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0, \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4, \ud1b5\uc81c \ub8e8\ud504 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc124\uacc4 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 AI(\ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5, \ub8e8\ud504 \uad6c\uc870)\uac00 \ud655\uc0b0\ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\ub958\u00b7\uc624\ub0a8\uc6a9\u00b7\uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uacc4 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uce58\uc6b0\uccd0 \uc788\uc5c8\uace0, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ub17c\uc758\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c(\ubaa9\ud45c \uad00\ub9ac\uc790, \ud50c\ub798\ub108, \ub3c4\uad6c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130, \uc2e4\ud589\uae30, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, \uac80\uc99d\uae30, \uc548\uc804 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130, \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac)\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uaddc\uc728 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4\u00b7\ubcf4\uc99d \ub8e8\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c-\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud655\uc7a5\ud615, \uacc4\ud68d/\uc790\uae30\uac1c\uc120\ud615, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc6f9/\ub85c\ubd07 \ub4f1 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ud0dd\uc18c\ub178\ubbf8\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc591\uc0c1\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc124\uacc4 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc(\ud0c0\uc785/\uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8, \uad8c\ud55c, \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860 \ub4f1)\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 AI\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc790\uccb4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(\uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654, \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc124\uacc4)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud06c\uac8c \uc88c\uc6b0\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\u00b7\uc2e4\ubb34\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \ud0dd\uc18c\ub2c8\ubbf8\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud328\ud134\ubcc4\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uacc4 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8(\uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \uac15\uc81c, \uac80\uc99d\uae30\u00b7\ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130 \ubc30\uce58, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad00\ub9ac, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc804 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub4f1)\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615/\uc0dd\uc131 AI\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud29c\ub2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4, \ubaa9\ud45c \uad00\ub9ac\u00b7\uacc4\ud68d\u00b7\ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\u00b7\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\u00b7\uac80\uc99d\u00b7\uc548\uc804 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\u00b7\ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uc774\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4/\ubcf4\uc99d \ub8e8\ud504\uac00 \ud575\uc2ec\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uacb0\ub860\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud0c0\uc785 \uc548\uc804\uc131, \uba71\ub4f1\uc131, \uad8c\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654, \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd9c\ucc98 \uad00\ub9ac, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc804 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ub4f1\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \uc124\uacc4 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc2e4\ubb34 \uc9c0\uce68\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Trio\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud574, \uc57d\ubb3c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ubd84\uc790\ub97c \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uba70 \uae30\uc874 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacb0\ud569 \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4\u00b7\uc57d\ubb3c\uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4\u00b7\ud569\uc131 \uc6a9\uc774\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc2e0\uc57d \ubc1c\uad74\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0, \uace0\uc18d \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\u00b7\ub3c4\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubd80\uc871\u00b7\ud574\uc11d \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\u00b7\uacb0\ud569 \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4 \ud3b8\uc911\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc57d\ubb3c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc4f0\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\uc801 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Trio\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Today's dominant tools trade off speed and flexibility: lexical classifiers (e.g., FastText) are fast but limited to producing classification output scores, while the vector-valued outputs of transformer text embedding models flexibly support numerous workflows (e.g., clustering, classification, and retrieval) but are computationally expensive to produce. We introduce Luxical, a library for high-speed \"lexical-dense\" text embeddings that aims to recover the best properties of both approaches for web-scale text organization. Luxical combines sparse TF--IDF features, a small ReLU network, and a knowledge distillation training regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at a fraction of their operational cost. In this technical report, we describe the Luxical architecture and training objective and evaluate a concrete Luxical model in two disparate applications: a targeted webcrawl document retrieval test and an end-to-end language model data curation task grounded in text classification. In these tasks we demonstrate speedups ranging from 3x to 100x over varying-sized neural baselines, and comparable to FastText model inference during the data curation task. On these evaluations, the tested Luxical model illustrates favorable compute/quality trade-offs for large-scale text organization, matching the quality of neural baselines.

An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances).

Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%.

However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1.

In our study, we investigated this potential using robust psychometric measures. We adapted the most studied test in psychological literature, namely Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and examined LLMs' behavior to identify traits. To asses the sensitivity of LLMs' prompts and psychological biases we created personality-oriented prompts, crafting a detailed set of personas that vary in trait intensity. This enables us to measure how well LLMs follow these roles. Our study introduces MindShift, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' psychological adaptability. The results highlight a consistent improvement in LLMs' role perception, attributed to advancements in training datasets and alignment techniques. Additionally, we observe significant differences in responses to psychometric assessments across different model types and families, suggesting variability in their ability to emulate human-like personality traits.

This paper introduces RIFT (Reinforcement Learning-guided Intelligent Fault Targeting), a scalable framework that automates the discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient design-time fault assessment. RIFT transforms the complex search for worst-case faults into a sequential decision-making problem, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites. Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \\textbf{2.2$\\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \\textbf{99\\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \\textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \\textbf{12.8$\\times$} improvement in \\textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection.

However, such approaches critically rely on the assumption that proxy reward models accurately reflect intended supervision, a condition often violated due to annotation noise, bias, or limited coverage. This misalignment can lead to undesirable behaviors, where models optimize for flawed signals rather than true human values. In this paper, we investigate a novel framework to identify and mitigate such misalignment by treating the fine-tuning process as a form of knowledge integration. We focus on detecting instances of proxy-policy conflicts, cases where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy. We argue that such conflicts often signify areas of shared ignorance, where neither the policy nor the reward model possesses sufficient knowledge, making them especially susceptible to misalignment. To this end, we propose two complementary metrics for identifying these conflicts: a localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance measure. Building on this insight, we design an algorithm named Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling (SHF-CAS) that targets high-conflict QA pairs for additional feedback, refining both the reward model and policy efficiently. Experiments on two alignment tasks demonstrate that our approach enhances general alignment performance, even when trained with a biased proxy reward. Our work provides a new lens for interpreting alignment failures and offers a principled pathway for targeted refinement in LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics

This token-first paradigm leads to drift, inconsistent reasoning modes, and growing prompts as conversations deepen. We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate. CORE offers a model-agnostic mechanism that separates conceptual reasoning from language generation, suggesting a scalable direction for more stable multi-turn systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CORE\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\ud134 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \u2018\ud1a0\ud070 \uc6b0\uc120\u2019 \ub300\uc2e0 \u2018\uac1c\ub150 \uc6b0\uc120\u2019 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ub300\ud654 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud1a0\ud070 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc740 \ud134\uc774 \ubc14\ub014 \ub54c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc774\uc804 \ub300\ud654 \uc804\uccb4\ub97c \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub123\uc5b4\uc57c \ud574\uc11c, \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud754\ub4e4\ub9ac\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\ubd80\ub97c \ubc14\uafb8\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uba40\ud2f0\ud134 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uacc4\uce35\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CORE\ub77c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150-\uc6b0\uc120 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants.

These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd94\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uae34 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(TCA-Attention)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758(self-attention)\ub294 \uae34 \ubc94\uc704 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc798 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\u00b7\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc774\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc218\uc2ed\ub9cc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub871\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucee4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ud76c\uc18c \uc8fc\uc758 \ubc0f KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098, \ud504\ub9ac\ud544\ub9c1/\ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc911 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub9cc \ub2e4\ub8e8\uac70\ub098, \ubcc4\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294, \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubc14\ub85c \uc4f8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ub871\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "TCA-Attention(Training-free Context-adaptive Attention)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc601\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc138\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c AI-\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc131\ubcc4, \uc778\uc885/\ubbfc\uc871, ELL \uc5ec\ubd80, \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ubc30\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \uc624\ud310\uc744 \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 AI\uac00 \uc4f4 \uae00\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uae09\uc99d\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc758 \uc624\ud310\uc774 \ud559\uc0dd\u00b7\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc790 \uc120\ubc1c, \ud3c9\uac00, \uc9d5\uacc4 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2ec\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uad50\uc721 \ud604\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc138\uc774\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0ac\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud45c\uc808/\ub300\ub9ac \uc791\uc131 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \ud310\ub2e8\ud560 \ub54c, \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uac00 \uc0ac\ud68c\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc57d\uc790\ub098 \uc18c\uc218\uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uae00\uc744 \u2018\uae30\uacc4\uac00 \uc4f4 \uae00\u2019\ub85c \uc798\ubabb \ubd84\ub958\ud55c\ub2e4\uba74 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubd88\uc774\uc775\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc138\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574, \ud604\uc7ac \ub110\ub9ac \uc4f0\uc774\ub294 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c4\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc138\uc774\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, 16\uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc601\uc5b4 \uae30\uacc4-\uc0dd\uc131 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc774 \uc5d0\uc138\uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc785\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc5d0\uc138\uc774\uac00 \u2018\uae30\uacc4 \uc791\uc131\u2019\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub420 \ud655\ub960\uc774\ub098 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc138\uc774\uc5d0\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc18d\uc131(\uc131\ubcc4, \uc778\uc885/\ubbfc\uc871, \uc601\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790 \uc5ec\ubd80(ELL), \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc9c0\uc704)\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uac01 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc758 \uc720\uc758\uc131\uacfc \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc18d\uc131 \uc870\ud569\ubcc4(\uc608: \ube44\ubc31\uc778+ELL \ub4f1) \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\ub85c, \uc0ac\ub78c \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc591\uc0c1\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc591\uc0c1\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \ud655\uc778\ub41c\ub2e4.

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud574, LLM\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ucd08\uae30 \ud55c \ubc88\ub9cc \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc11c\ube0c\uace8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\u00b7\uc0ac\uc804\ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud50c\ub798\ub108 SCOPE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 LLM \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc \ud6e8\uc52c \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf5\uc7a1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \uad00\uce21\uc774 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uba70 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ud76c\ubc15\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

A preliminary version of this work was presented at CALCO 2025, under the title \"An Algebraic Approach to Moralisation and Triangulation of Probabilistic Graphical Models''", "summary": "Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \u2018\ub3c4\ub355\ud654(moralisation)\u2019\uc640 \u2018\uc0bc\uac01\ud654(triangulation)\u2019 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub860\uc801(\uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \uc774\ub860) \ud2c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud391\ud130\ub85c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud655\ub960 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(\uc720\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504)\uc640 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(\ubb34\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504)\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc778\uc218\ubd84\ud574 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub450 \ud45c\ud604 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \ubcc0\ud658(\ub3c4\ub355\ud654, \uc0bc\uac01\ud654)\uc740 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801\u00b7\uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uc124\uba85\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \ub354 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub860 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uae30\uc220\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \ubb38\ubc95\uc801(\uad6c\ubb38\uc801, syntactic) \ubcc0\ud658\uc774\uace0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801(semantic, \uc2e4\uc81c \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec \uad00\ub828) \ubcc0\ud658\uc778\uc9c0 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "1) \u2018\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubc94\uc8fc\u2019\uc640 \u2018\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubc94\uc8fc\u2019\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \u2018\ubb38\ubc95(syntax) \u2192 \uc758\ubbf8(semantics)\u2019 \ud391\ud130\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.\n2) \ub3c4\ub355\ud654\ub97c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc94\uc8fc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc94\uc8fc\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \ud391\ud130\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.\n3) \uc0bc\uac01\ud654\ub97c \ubc18\ub300 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub418, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \uc758\ubbf8(\ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4.\n4) \ubcc0\uc218 \uc18c\uac70(variable elimination) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \ud391\ud130\ub85c \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0bc\uac01\ud654\ub97c (a) \uc21c\uc218 \ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84\uacfc (b) \uc21c\uc218 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub3c4\ub355\ud654\uc640 \uc0bc\uac01\ud654\uac00 \uac01\uac01 \ubc94\uc8fc \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ud391\ud130\ub85c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub3c4\ub355\ud654\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uad6c\ubb38\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uc778 \ubc18\uba74, \uc0bc\uac01\ud654\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4(\ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uc784\uc744 \uc774 \ud2c0 \uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218 \uc18c\uac70 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0bc\uac01\ud654 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ub450 \ubd80\ubd84(\uad6c\ubb38/\uc758\ubbf8)\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\ub294 \ud391\ud130\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud655\ub960 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub860\uc801\u00b7\ud391\ud130\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548/\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubcc0\ud658\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub098\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801(\uad6c\ubb38\uc801) \uc218\uc815\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc218\uc815\uc774 \uac1c\ub150\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub418\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub2e4\ub978 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658, \ucd94\ub860 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Prior NLP efforts emphasize technical headnotes, ignoring citizen-oriented communication needs. We introduce CourtPressGER, a 6.4k dataset of triples: rulings, human-drafted press releases, and synthetic prompts for LLMs to generate comparable releases. This benchmark trains and evaluates LLMs in generating accurate, readable summaries from long judicial texts. We benchmark small and large LLMs using reference-based metrics, factual-consistency checks, LLM-as-judge, and expert ranking. Large LLMs produce high-quality drafts with minimal hierarchical performance loss; smaller models require hierarchical setups for long judgments.

To address the limitations of traditional financial decision methods that rely on parameterized knowledge, lack factual consistency, and miss reasoning chains, an integrated framework is proposed that combines external knowledge retrieval, semantic representation, and reasoning generation. The method first encodes financial texts and structured data to obtain semantic representations, and then retrieves task-related information from external knowledge bases using similarity computation. Internal representations and external knowledge are combined through weighted fusion, which ensures fluency while improving factual accuracy and completeness of generated content. In the reasoning stage, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to construct logical chains, allowing the model to present transparent causal relationships and traceability during generation. Finally, the model jointly optimizes task objectives and explanation consistency objectives, which enhances predictive performance and reasoning interpretability. Experiments on financial text processing and decision tasks show that the method outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, text generation quality, and factual support, verifying the effectiveness of knowledge enhancement and explainable reasoning. Overall, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of traditional models in semantic coverage and reasoning transparency, and demonstrates strong practical value in complex financial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uac15\ud654 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae08\uc735 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uae08\uc735 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 (1) \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc18\uc601\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, (2) \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, (3) \uc608\uce21 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\u00b7\uc778\uacfc \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc LLM\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud574, \uc2e4\uc81c \uae08\uc735 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) \uae08\uc735 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130(\uc608: \uc7ac\ubb34\uc9c0\ud45c)\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.

The framework includes text encoding, contextual representation modeling, attention-based enhancement, feature aggregation, and classification prediction. In the representation stage, deep semantic embeddings are obtained through large-scale pretrained language models, and attention mechanisms are applied to enhance the selective representation of key features. In the aggregation stage, global and weighted strategies are combined to generate robust text-level vectors. In the classification stage, a fully connected layer and Softmax output are used to predict class distributions, and cross-entropy loss is employed to optimize model parameters. Comparative experiments introduce multiple baseline models, including recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and Transformers, and evaluate them on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on all metrics, with especially strong improvements in Recall and AUC. In addition, sensitivity experiments are conducted on hyperparameters and data conditions, covering the impact of hidden dimensions on AUC and the impact of class imbalance ratios on Recall.

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of LLM-SEs, analyzing 55,936 queries and the corresponding search results across six LLM-SEs and two TSEs. We confirm that LLM-SEs cites domain resources with greater diversity than TSEs. Indeed, 37% of domains are unique to LLM-SEs. However, certain risks still persist: LLM-SEs do not outperform TSEs in credibility, political neutrality and safety metrics. Finally, to understand the selection criteria of LLM-SEs, we perform a feature-based analysis to identify key factors influencing source choice.

While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \\model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \\model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \\model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(\\model{})\ub97c

However, their widespread deployment currently suffers from methodological fragmentation and a lack of systematic soundness. This study proposes two comprehensive methodological frameworks designed to guide the strategic and responsible application of LLMs in language sciences. The first method-selection framework defines and systematizes three distinct, complementary approaches, each linked to a specific research goal: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-use models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning of open-source models for confirmatory, theory-driven investigation and high-quality data generation; and (3) extraction of contextualized embeddings for further quantitative analysis and probing of model internal mechanisms. We detail the technical implementation and inherent trade-offs of each method, supported by empirical case studies. Based on the method-selection framework, the second systematic framework proposed provides constructed configurations that guide the practical implementation of multi-stage research pipelines based on these approaches. We then conducted a series of empirical experiments to validate our proposed framework, employing retrospective analysis, prospective application, and an expert evaluation survey. By enforcing the strategic alignment of research questions with the appropriate LLM methodology, the frameworks enable a critical paradigm shift in language science research. We believe that this system is fundamental for ensuring reproducibility, facilitating the critical evaluation of LLM mechanisms, and providing the structure necessary to move traditional linguistics from ad-hoc utility to verifiable, robust science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uacfc\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc885\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(\ubc29\ubc95 \uc120\ud0dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uacfc\ud559 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc81c\uac01\uac01 \uc784\uc758\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uac15\ud574 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud30c\ud3b8\ud654, \uccb4\uacc4 \ubd80\uc871, \uc7ac\ud604\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c \ub4f1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uacfc LLM \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc2dd \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uacfc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) \uc5f0\uad6c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM \ud65c\uc6a9 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\u00b7\uc815\uc758: (a) \ubc94\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uac00\uc124 \uc0dd\uc131, (b) \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub860 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801 \uac80\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131, (c) \ub9e5\ub77d\ud654 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574 \uc815\ub7c9 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ub0b4\ubd80 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ud504\ub85c\ube59. \uac01 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uad6c\ud604 \ubc29\ubc95, \uc7a5\ub2e8\uc810, \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc0c1\uc138\ud788 \uae30\uc220.

These scores were similar to human annotators, however several differences emerged, suggesting that while LLM based automatic subjectivity scoring is feasible, it is not an interchangeable alternative to human annotation, and its suitability depends on the intended application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub2c8\uc544\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uad00\uc131 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc810\uc218(0~100)\ub85c \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ub78c\uacfc LLM(GPT-5)\uc758 \uc8fc\uad00\uc131 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub2c8\uc544\uc5b4\ucc98\ub7fc \uc18c\uc218 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac10\uc131\u00b7\uc8fc\uad00\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc6a9 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ubb38\uc7a5 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \u2018\ubb38\uc11c \uc804\uccb4\u2019\uc758 \uc8fc\uad00\uc131 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc5d0\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub2c8\uc544\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc8fc\uad00\uc131 \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d\u00b7\uc5b8\ub860 \ubd84\uc11d \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ucd5c\uadfc LLM\uc774 \uc0ac\ub78c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \uc5b4\ub290 \uc815\ub3c4 \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ub3c4 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "1,000\uac1c \uc5d0\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub2c8\uc544\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc11c(\uc5b8\ub860 \uae30\uc0ac 300\ud3b8, \uc6f9 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 700\ud3b8)\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, 4\uba85\uc758 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\uac00 \uac01 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 0(\uc644\uc804 \uac1d\uad00)~100(\uc644\uc804 \uc8fc\uad00) \uc5f0\uc18d \ucc99\ub3c4\ub85c \uc8fc\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud588\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uacc4\uc218\uac00 \uc911\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \uadf8\uce58\uace0 \uc77c\ubd80 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc810\uc218\uac00 \ub098\uc628 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud55c \ub4a4, \uac00\uc7a5 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \ud070 \ubb38\uc11c \ud558\uc704\uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc8fc\uc11d\ud574 \uc0c1\uad00\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\ub85c, \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 GPT-5\uac00 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\ub78c \uc8fc\uc11d\uacfc\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4\u00b7\ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\ub78c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\ub4e4 \uac04 \uc0c1\uad00\uc740 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \u2018\uc911\uac04 \uc815\ub3c4\u2019\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uc7ac\uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub17c\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc11c\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud569\uc758\uac00 \ub2e4\uc18c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

Large language models (LLMs) offer scalable and accessible assistance, yet their deployment in mental-health settings remains risky when their reasoning is incomplete, inconsistent, or ungrounded. Existing psychological LLMs emphasize emotional understanding or knowledge recall but overlook the step-wise, clinically aligned reasoning required for appraisal, diagnosis, intervention planning, abstraction, and verification. To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning five core reasoning aspects, six tasks, and 13 datasets, evaluating both task performance and reasoning quality across five dimensions: conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories. Across 20 evaluated LLMs, Mindora achieves the highest average performance on MentraBench and shows remarkable performances in reasoning reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex mental-health scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba58\ud0c8\ud5ec\uc2a4 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\u00b7\ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c(MentraBench)\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378(Mindora)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6f9\uacfc LLM\uc774 \uc815\uc2e0\uac74\uac15 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc218\ub2e8\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \uc2ec\ub9ac\u00b7\uc815\uc2e0\uc758\ud559\uc6a9 LLM\ub4e4\uc740 \uac10\uc815 \uc774\ud574\ub098 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc554\uae30\uc5d0 \uce58\uc6b0\uccd0 \uc788\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801\u00b7\uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860(\ud3c9\uac00, \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uac1c\uc785 \uacc4\ud68d, \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654, \uac80\uc99d)\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\uc131, \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ud658\uac01\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uc2dc \ud070 \uc704\ud5d8\uc694\uc778\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\uc2e0\uac74\uac15 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "1) MentraSuite\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uc548\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\ub294 MentraBench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.

Revisiting LLM Reliability in Hate Speech Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hate speech spreads widely online, harming individuals and communities, making automatic detection essential for large-scale moderation, yet detecting it remains difficult. Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $\u03ba$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\ud654 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uac04 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(xRR)\ub85c LLM\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub2e4\ub974\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5 \u2018\uc21c\uc704\u2019\ub97c \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac \ud3c9\uac00\uc790(proxy)\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\ud654\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\ud654\ub85c \ubcfc\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ucc28\uc774 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud569\uc758\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ud45c(Cohen\u2019s \u03ba \ub4f1)\ub294 \uc774\ub7f0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c \u2018\uc624\ub958\u2019\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \uc5ed\uc2dc \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ube44\ud310\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c(subjectivity-aware) \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 cross-Rater Reliability(xRR)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 LLM\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\uc758 \ub77c\ubca8 \uc77c\uce58\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\ud654 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790 \uac04 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04\u2013LLM \uac04\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ub97c xRR\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud574 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ud569\uc758\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5b4 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \ub77c\ubca8\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc21c\uc704\uc640 LLM \ub77c\ubca8\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c \uc21c\uc704\uac00 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294\uc9c0(\uc21c\uc704 \ubcf4\uc874 \uc5ec\ubd80)\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "xRR \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 LLM \ub77c\ubca8\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\uc640 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, LLM\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc21c\uc704\uc640 \ud328\ud134\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ub77c\ubca8 \uae30\uc900 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc989 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \u2018\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c\uc9c0\u2019\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc21c\uc704\ub294 LLM \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \uc368\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ub2f9 \ubd80\ubd84 \ubcf4\uc874\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc740 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \uc8fc\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ub2e8\uc704 \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \ubabb\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5 \ube44\uad50\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 NLP \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc740 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub300\uccb4\uc7ac\ub77c\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\u00b7\uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \u2018\ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\u2019\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc18c\ub7c9

For each language, FineFreq provides per-character statistics with aggregate and year-level frequencies, allowing fine-grained temporal analysis. The dataset preserves naturally occurring multilingual features such as cross-script borrowings, emoji, and acronyms without applying artificial filtering. Each character entry includes Unicode metadata (category, script, block), enabling domain-specific or other downstream filtering and analysis.

This study establishes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient framework to address these challenges in dedicated NMT architectures. We first demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts NMT models to new languages and domains with performance on par with full-parameter techniques, while utilizing only a fraction of the parameter space. Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 NMT\uc5d0\uc11c LoRA\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc801\uc740 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub85c \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud615 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778/\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc870\uc808\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "NMT \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\u00b7\ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub824\uba74 \uc804\uccb4 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud574 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\uace0, \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc78a\ub294 catastrophic forgetting \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "1) LoRA \uae30\ubc18 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\u00b7\ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. 2) \uc5ec\ub7ec LoRA \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5c6\ub294 mixture-of-experts\ucc98\ub7fc \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud615 \uc801\uc751 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud574, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\u00b7\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ud55c\ub2e4. 3) \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \ubd84\ud574 \ud589\ub82c\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec, \uacfc\uac70 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 LoRA \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucc28\ub4f1 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \uc8fc\uc5b4 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "LoRA \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud615 LoRA \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\u00b7\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc870\uc808\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc0c8 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ub3c4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LoRA\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 NMT\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud615\u00b7\uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub85c catastrophic forgetting\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\u00b7\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud574, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 NMT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing work either relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that over-fits surface cues and yields low diversity, or applies reinforcement learning (RL) that fails to learn multiple dimensions for comprehensive RPA optimization. We present MOA (Multi-Objective Alignment), a reinforcement-learning framework that enables multi-dimensional, fine-grained rubric optimization for general RPAs. MOA introduces a novel multi-objective optimization strategy that trains simultaneously on multiple fine-grained rubrics to boost optimization performance. Besides, to address the issues of model output diversity and quality, we have also employed thought-augmented rollout with off-policy guidance. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks such as PersonaGym and RoleMRC show that MOA enables an 8B model to match or even outperform strong baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude across numerous dimensions.

Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks. This highlights the strong temporal awareness of our model across modalities, while preserving general video and audio understanding capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChronusOmni\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\u00b7\uc624\ub514\uc624\u00b7\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801/\uc554\uc2dc\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud30c\uc545(temporal grounding)\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \uc634\ub2c8 LLM\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \u2018\uc5b8\uc81c\uac00?\u2019 \u2018\ubb34\uc5c7\uc774 \uc5b8\uc81c?\u2019 \uac19\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \uce58\uc6b0\uccd0 \uc788\uace0, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \ub9d0-\ud654\uba74 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc131\ucc98\ub7fc \uc554\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc798 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3d9\uc601\uc0c1 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0\ub294 \uc774\ub7f0 \ubcf5\ud569\uc801\u00b7\uad50\ucc28\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc9c0\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc634\ub2c8 LLM\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uc704\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud0ec\ud504 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc2dc\uac01\u00b7\uc624\ub514\uc624 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uad50\ucc28 \uc0bd\uc785\ud574, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd95\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.

Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language. A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative. This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities. Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential. The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.", "AI": {"tldr":
