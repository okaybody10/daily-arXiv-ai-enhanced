### [1] [In Vino Veritas and Vulnerabilities: Examining LLM Safety via Drunk Language Inducement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22169)
*Anudeex Shetty,Aditya Joshi,Salil S. Kanhere*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that inducing “drunk language” in LLMs (through prompts or fine-tuning) makes them easier to jailbreak and more prone to privacy leaks, exposing a new safety risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human behavior under alcohol often becomes reckless and privacy-insensitive; the authors hypothesize that simulating this state in LLMs via language style (“drunk language”) might systematically weaken safety controls and increase security/privacy failures. They want to understand whether this is true, how strong the effect is, and how easily it can be induced.

Method: They define and induce “drunk language” in LLMs via three mechanisms: (1) persona-based prompting where the model is instructed to act/speak like a drunk person, (2) causal fine-tuning on drunk-style text, and (3) reinforcement-based post-training to reinforce drunk-like responses. They then evaluate 5 different LLMs on standard English safety benchmarks: JailbreakBench for jailbreak susceptibility (even with existing defences active) and ConfAIde for privacy leak propensity. Evaluation includes both manual human analysis and LLM-based evaluators to categorize and quantify error types and safety failures.

Result: Across all five models, inducing drunk language consistently increases jailbreak success rates on JailbreakBench and the frequency/severity of privacy leaks on ConfAIde, compared both to the original base models and to previously proposed attack/inducement approaches. The error analysis shows patterns of behavior under drunk language that mirror human intoxication: reduced inhibition, worse judgment, and looser handling of private information. These patterns also relate to anthropomorphic traits in LLM behaviour under this induced style.

Conclusion: Simple, low-cost methods that induce drunk language in LLMs can significantly undermine existing safety training and defences, acting as effective “counters” to safety-tuning techniques. This reveals a concerning vulnerability: stylistic or persona-based manipulations (here, simulating drunkenness) can substantially erode safety, calling for more robust safety mechanisms that are resilient to such behavioural shifts and anthropomorphic exploitations.

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to undesirable behaviours and privacy leaks under the influence of alcohol. This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.

### [2] [MrRoPE: Mixed-radix Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22181)
*Qingyuan Tian,Wenhong Zhu,Xiaoran Liu,Xiaofeng Wang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MrRoPE, a unified theoretical framework for extending Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to much longer contexts, and two practical, training-free variants (MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro) that achieve strong long-context generalization without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RoPE extension methods for long-context language models are ad hoc and heterogeneous, lacking a common theoretical explanation and principled design guidelines. There is a need for a unified view that explains these methods and leads to better, training-free approaches that enable 'train short, test long' usage of LLMs.

Method: The authors reinterpret RoPE extension as a mixed-radix system conversion problem, where different extension tricks correspond to different radix conversion strategies. They formalize this as MrRoPE (Mixed-radix RoPE), a generalized encoding formulation. Building on this, they design two specific strategies: MrRoPE-Uni, which uses a uniform radix conversion, and MrRoPE-Pro, which uses a progressive radix schedule to better allocate positional resolution across the sequence. Both are plug-in, training-free modifications to RoPE in existing models.

Result: Without any fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro maintains over 85% recall on the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmark, and more than doubles YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue tasks, demonstrating substantially improved long-context performance. Theoretical analysis shows that MrRoPE-Pro increases the upper bound of the maximum effective encoding length that RoPE can support.

Conclusion: MrRoPE provides a unifying theoretical lens on RoPE extension techniques via mixed-radix system conversion and yields new, training-free schemes that greatly enhance long-context generalization. The success and theoretical guarantees of MrRoPE-Pro indicate that principled radix design can both explain existing heuristics and produce better long-context positional encodings for LLMs.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)-extension refers to modifying or generalizing the Rotary Position Embedding scheme to handle longer sequences than those encountered during pre-training. However, current extension strategies are highly diverse and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose MrRoPE (Mixed-radix RoPE), a generalized encoding formulation based on a radix system conversion perspective, which elegantly unifies various RoPE-extension approaches as distinct radix conversion strategies. Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets. Theoretical analysis confirms that MrRoPE-Pro effectively raises the upper bound of RoPE's attainable encoding length, which further validates the reliability and utility of our theory and methodology.

### [3] [Prepare Reasoning Language Models for Multi-Agent Debate with Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22297)
*Chenxi Liu,Yanshuo Chen,Ruibo Chen,Tianyi Xiong,Tong Zheng,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that makes a single large language model good both at standalone reasoning and at participating in multi-agent debate by learning from multiple internally generated reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly boosts LLM reasoning but trains models to solve problems in isolation. Meanwhile, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) at test time shows that having multiple models argue can improve answers, yet models are not explicitly trained to integrate and benefit from the diverse rationales that appear in such debates. There is a gap: current methods do not prepare a single model to leverage debate-style, multi-trajectory reasoning during training.

Method: Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL) extends RLVR by simulating a debate within a single model during training. For each prompt, the model first samples multiple diverse candidate solutions (first-turn responses). These are assembled into a debate-like context, representing different reasoning paths. The model then generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context, effectively responding to and synthesizing the earlier arguments. A joint optimization objective is used to train both the initial standalone responses and the debate-conditioned second-turn responses with verifiable rewards, teaching the model to both solve problems directly and to refine its reasoning based on multiple trajectories.

Result: Across several base models and multiple reasoning benchmarks, models trained with SDRL show improved performance when used in Multi-Agent Debate settings, demonstrating better collaborative reasoning. At the same time, their single-model, no-debate reasoning performance also improves compared to standard RLVR or baseline models, indicating that SDRL strengthens both standalone and debate-based reasoning.

Conclusion: SDRL is an effective training framework for LLMs that unifies standalone RLVR-style training with debate-style multi-trajectory reasoning. By training one model to generate, consume, and refine diverse reasoning paths, SDRL yields LLMs that are stronger both as individual solvers and as participants in Multi-Agent Debate, leading to overall better reasoning performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have been substantially improved by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). At test time, collaborative reasoning through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance. However, current RLVR methods typically train LLMs to solve problems in isolation, without explicitly preparing them to synthesize and benefit from different rationales that arise during debate. In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant. Experiments across multiple base models and reasoning benchmarks show that SDRL improves overall MAD performance while simultaneously strengthening single model reasoning.

### [4] [MERMAID: Memory-Enhanced Retrieval and Reasoning with Multi-Agent Iterative Knowledge Grounding for Veracity Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22361)
*Yupeng Cao,Chengyang He,Yangyang Yu,Ping Wang,K. P. Subbalakshmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERMAID is a memory-enhanced multi-agent framework that couples retrieval and reasoning to improve automated veracity assessment, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and search efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online misinformation is prevalent, and assessing the truthfulness of online claims at scale is challenging. Existing LLM-based veracity assessment systems break claims into sub-claims and retrieve evidence, but treat retrieval as a static, one-off step, failing to coordinate retrieval and reasoning or reuse evidence across multiple claims. This leads to redundant searches, inefficiency, and inconsistent verification decisions. There is a need for a system that dynamically integrates search, reasoning, and memory to better support fact-checking and claim verification.

Method: The paper proposes MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent framework for veracity assessment. It employs multiple agents in a Reason-Action iterative loop: agents perform agent-driven search to retrieve external evidence, structure it into knowledge representations, and store it within a persistent evidence memory. The system tightly couples retrieval and reasoning by allowing agents to iteratively request additional evidence based on current reasoning state and to reuse previously retrieved evidence (cross-claim and cross-step). The architecture supports different LLM backbones (GPT, LLaMA, Qwen) and operates over standard fact-checking and claim-verification pipelines, but with dynamic evidence acquisition and memory-based reuse.

Result: On three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets, using multiple LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, Qwen), MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance in veracity assessment. It also improves search efficiency by reducing redundant evidence retrieval through its evidence memory mechanism, leading to both better accuracy and reduced retrieval cost compared to prior methods that treat retrieval as a static, isolated step.

Conclusion: Coupling retrieval and reasoning via a memory-enhanced multi-agent framework significantly improves automated veracity assessment. MERMAID demonstrates that persistent evidence memory, dynamic iterative search, and structured knowledge representations enable more efficient and consistent fact-checking and claim verification across diverse LLMs and datasets. This suggests that future systems for veracity assessment and related tasks should treat retrieval, reasoning, and memory as tightly integrated components rather than separate pipeline stages.

Abstract: Assessing the veracity of online content has become increasingly critical. Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Experimental results show that MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance while improving the search efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of synergizing retrieval, reasoning, and memory for reliable veracity assessment.

### [5] [Context Structure Reshapes the Representational Geometry of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22364)
*Eghbal A. Hosseini,Yuxuan Li,Yasaman Bahri,Declan Campbell,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how the internal representations of large language models become geometrically “straighter” during in‑context learning, and shows this straightening depends strongly on the task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work found that LLMs’ hidden states often form straighter trajectories across layers, which may help next-token prediction by enabling linear extrapolation. Separately, other work shows that LLMs change their internal representations during in‑context learning to adapt to new tasks. However, it is unclear whether the same representation straightening occurs dynamically within a context as a model performs different types of tasks. The paper aims to unify these lines of work and understand when and how representational straightening emerges during ICL, and what that reveals about the underlying mechanisms.

Method: The authors analyze Gemma 2 models on a diverse suite of in‑context learning tasks, divided into continual prediction tasks (such as natural language continuation and grid‑world traversal) and structured prediction or few‑shot tasks (like template-based input–output mappings). They quantify “representational straightening” by measuring how straight the neural trajectories are in hidden-state space as the input sequence unfolds, comparing early vs. later parts of the context and relating these geometric changes to prediction performance. They then compare patterns of straightening across task types and task phases.

Result: In continual prediction settings, longer context generally leads to straighter neural trajectories in deeper layers, and this straightening is positively correlated with improved next-token prediction performance. In structured prediction or few‑shot settings, the pattern is more complex: representational straightening appears mainly during phases with clear, explicit structure (such as repeated templates or regular patterns) and largely disappears in other phases. This reveals a dichotomy in how representations evolve depending on the task’s temporal and structural properties.

Conclusion: In‑context learning is not a single, uniform mechanism in LLMs. Instead, models appear to switch between multiple internal strategies depending on task structure. Some strategies—especially those used in continual prediction tasks and highly structured phases—induce straighter representational trajectories that support linear extrapolation, while others do not. The authors propose an analogy to a “Swiss Army knife”: LLMs dynamically choose among different internal tools or modes of computation, only some of which manifest as representation straightening during in‑context learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to organize the representations of input sequences into straighter neural trajectories in their deep layers, which has been hypothesized to facilitate next-token prediction via linear extrapolation. Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.

### [6] [Stability-Aware Prompt Optimization for Clinical Data Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22373)
*Arinbjörn Kolbeinsson,Daniel Timbie,Sajjan Narsinghani,Sanjay Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how sensitive clinical LLMs are to prompt wording and argues that accuracy and prompt stability must be optimized together.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most clinical LLM work assumes a fixed prompt and only analyzes prediction uncertainty, but in practice, changing prompt wording can drastically alter outputs. This is risky for clinical use, so the authors want to understand and mitigate this prompt sensitivity.

Method: They evaluate several open and proprietary LLMs on two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and multiple sclerosis subtype abstraction), measure prompt sensitivity using flip rates under paraphrased prompts, relate this to calibration and selective prediction metrics, and then introduce a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that simultaneously optimizes for accuracy and stability to paraphrases.

Result: They empirically show that better accuracy does not imply more stable predictions, and that models can look well-calibrated yet remain highly sensitive to paraphrase changes. The proposed dual-objective optimization that adds an explicit stability term successfully reduces flip rates for multiple tasks and models, though sometimes with a small trade-off in accuracy.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity is an important, distinct dimension of reliability for clinical LLMs. Clinical validation should treat prompts as variables, and prompt optimization should explicitly include stability to paraphrases rather than focusing solely on accuracy or calibration.

Abstract: Large language models used for clinical abstraction are sensitive to prompt wording, yet most work treats prompts as fixed and studies uncertainty in isolation. We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost. Our results suggest prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective when validating clinical LLM systems.

### [7] [SPLA: Block Sparse Plus Linear Attention for Long Context Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22379)
*Bailin Wang,Dan Friedman,Tao Lei,Chong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPLA combines accurate block-wise sparse attention with a residual linear attention path that summarizes unselected blocks, improving long-context efficiency without sacrificing important context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing block-wise sparse attention mechanisms speed up long-context Transformers by attending only to selected blocks, but they often mis-select relevant blocks and discard the rest entirely. This causes cumulative loss of contextual information and a performance gap versus dense attention, especially in continual pretraining and long-context tasks. The paper aims to retain efficiency while preserving information from unselected blocks and improving the fidelity of block selection.

Method: The authors propose Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA). First, they design a selection metric based on second-order Taylor expansion to more accurately estimate each block’s contribution and select the most relevant ones for exact attention. Second, instead of discarding non-selected blocks, they pass them through a residual linear attention (RLA) module that compresses these blocks into a compact recurrent state, capturing their aggregate influence. To prevent IO overhead, they derive a subtraction-based formulation: the residual is computed as the difference between global linear attention over all tokens and linear attention over the selected blocks, so the “long tail” blocks never need to be individually accessed at inference time.

Result: Empirically, SPLA narrows and even eliminates the performance gap between sparse and dense attention in continual pretraining settings. On long-context benchmarks such as RULER, SPLA surpasses dense attention models, while still maintaining competitive performance on general knowledge and reasoning tasks that are not primarily long-context focused.

Conclusion: SPLA shows that combining a principled, second-order-based block selection strategy with a residual linear attention summary of unselected tokens can deliver both efficiency and high fidelity in long-context modeling. The approach avoids the major weaknesses of prior block-wise sparse attention—poor selection fidelity and discarded context—while remaining practical through an IO-efficient subtraction-based implementation.

Abstract: Block-wise sparse attention offers significant efficiency gains for long-context modeling, yet existing methods often suffer from low selection fidelity and cumulative contextual loss by completely discarding unselected blocks. To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining "long tail," SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SPLA closes the performance gap in continual pretraining, surpassing dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

### [8] [SP^2DPO: An LLM-assisted Semantic Per-Pair DPO Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22385)
*Chaoyue He,Xin Zhou,Di Wang,Hong Xu,Wei Liu,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SP2DPO modifies Direct Preference Optimization by assigning a different temperature β to each preference pair, based on semantic gap annotations from teacher LMs, to better handle heterogeneous and noisy preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO uses a single global temperature β, implicitly assuming all preference pairs are equally informative. Real-world preference datasets mix highly informative, objective failures (e.g., safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective preferences (e.g., style), and may contain noisy labels. This heterogeneity is not reflected in a single β, limiting the method's ability to emphasize high-signal pairs and de-emphasize low-signal or noisy ones. The authors aim to create a method that can automatically and systematically weight preference pairs by their semantic importance and reliability, without adding training-time complexity.

Method: They propose SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), which generalizes DPO by replacing the single global temperature β with an instance-specific β_i for each preference pair. These β_i values are pre-computed offline using structured semantic-gap annotations between the preferred and dispreferred responses. Teacher language models provide annotations such as category (type of difference, e.g., safety, factuality, style), magnitude (how large the quality gap is), and confidence. From these annotations, a per-pair temperature schedule β_i is derived. Training then proceeds using the standard DPO objective, but with β set to β_i for each pair, so the optimizer and inner loop remain unchanged and no extra training-time cost is incurred. They instantiate the approach on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), producing a large-scale, auditable artifact of β_i values linked to each pair.

Result: On AlpacaEval 2.0, evaluated by both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate, SP2DPO is competitive with a carefully tuned global-β DPO baseline across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student models (4B–8B). It improves the length-controlled win rate on two of the four backbones, while eliminating the need for per-model hyperparameter sweeps over β. The method scales to tens of thousands of preference pairs and keeps training-time overhead at zero, since only an offline pre-annotation step is added.

Conclusion: SP2DPO shows that replacing a single global temperature with semantically informed, per-pair β_i values can better exploit heterogeneous preference datasets without complicating training. It provides comparable or better performance to tuned global-β DPO, improves length-controlled outcomes in several settings, and removes the need for computationally expensive β sweeps. The approach also yields an auditable artifact of per-pair importance weights derived from teacher-LM semantic annotations, which could be useful for understanding and curating preference data. All resources will be made publicly available, facilitating adoption and further research.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) controls the trade-off between fitting preference labels and staying close to a reference model using a single global temperature beta, implicitly treating all preference pairs as equally informative. Real-world preference corpora are heterogeneous: they mix high-signal, objective failures (for example, safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective distinctions (for example, style), and also include label noise. We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps. All code, annotations, and artifacts will be released.

### [9] [Specialists or Generalists? Multi-Agent and Single-Agent LLMs for Essay Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22386)
*Jamiu Adekunle Idowu,Ahmed Almasoud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares single-agent and multi-agent large language model architectures for automated essay scoring on the ASAP 2.0 corpus, finding that multi-agent models better detect weak essays, single-agent models do better on mid-range essays, both struggle with top essays, and few-shot calibration with two examples per score level yields a large performance gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models are increasingly used in automated essay scoring, it is unclear how different model architectures (single vs multi-agent) affect grading performance across essay quality levels and how much few-shot calibration matters. The paper aims to fill this gap to guide practitioners in choosing appropriate AES system designs for different educational use cases.

Method: The authors use the ASAP 2.0 essay corpus to evaluate two LLM-based AES architectures, both powered by GPT-5.1: (1) a single-agent model that directly outputs holistic scores, and (2) a multi-agent model where three specialist agents (Content, Structure, Language) assess specific dimensions and feed into a Chairman Agent that applies rubric-aligned logic, including veto rules and score caps. They run experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with few-shot prompts including two example essays per score level, and compare systems using quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) across low-, mid-, and high-quality essays.

Result: The multi-agent architecture significantly outperforms the single-agent model on low-quality essays, improving detection and differentiation of weak writing. The single-agent model performs better on mid-range essays. Both systems underperform on high-quality essays, failing to reliably distinguish the very top scores. The most influential factor is few-shot calibration; adding just two examples per score level to the prompt improves QWK by around 26% for both architectures.

Conclusion: System design for LLM-based AES should be matched to deployment priorities: multi-agent architectures are particularly effective for diagnostic screening and identification of at-risk students (weak essays), while single-agent systems are more cost-effective and adequate for general assessment of the bulk of essays. In all cases, careful few-shot calibration with representative examples is critical, as it yields substantial performance gains regardless of architecture. Further work is needed to better handle high-quality essays.

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) systems increasingly rely on large language models, yet little is known about how architectural choices shape their performance across different essay quality levels. This paper evaluates single-agent and multi-agent LLM architectures for essay grading using the ASAP 2.0 corpus. Our multi-agent system decomposes grading into three specialist agents (Content, Structure, Language) coordinated by a Chairman Agent that implements rubric-aligned logic including veto rules and score capping. We test both architectures in zero-shot and few-shot conditions using GPT-5.1. Results show that the multi-agent system is significantly better at identifying weak essays while the single-agent system performs better on mid-range essays. Both architectures struggle with high-quality essays. Critically, few-shot calibration emerges as the dominant factor in system performance -- providing just two examples per score level improves QWK by approximately 26% for both architectures. These findings suggest architectural choice should align with specific deployment priorities, with multi-agent AI particularly suited for diagnostic screening of at-risk students, while single-agent models provide a cost-effective solution for general assessment.

### [10] [Culturally Grounded Personas in Large Language Models: Characterization and Alignment with Socio-Psychological Value Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22396)
*Candida M. Greco,Lucio La Cava,Andrea Tagarelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well LLM-generated, culturally-grounded personas replicate human worldviews and moral values across cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used to simulate humans, including for social science and policy-related tasks, it is unclear whether their synthetic personas faithfully mirror real cross-cultural value systems and moral patterns. The authors aim to test and quantify that alignment.

Method: The authors construct culturally-grounded synthetic personas by conditioning an LLM on interpretable variables derived from the World Values Survey (WVS). They then evaluate these personas using three approaches: (1) locating them on the Inglehart-Welzel cultural map to see if the learned structure mirrors stable cultural differences; (2) comparing persona-level response distributions with real WVS demographic group patterns; and (3) administering a Moral Foundations questionnaire to the personas, then analyzing the results via a culture-to-morality mapping to study how moral responses change with cultural configurations.

Result: The generated personas show structured positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map that reflects stable cross-cultural differences, exhibit response distributions that broadly track human demographic patterns observed in WVS data, and display systematic, interpretable variation in Moral Foundations profiles across cultural configurations.

Conclusion: Culturally-grounded persona generation with LLMs can reproduce key aspects of cross-cultural value structures and moral variation, and the proposed framework offers a way to evaluate and analyze the alignment between synthetic personas and established empirical models of human culture and morality.

Abstract: Despite the growing utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior, the extent to which these synthetic personas accurately reflect world and moral value systems across different cultural conditionings remains uncertain. This paper investigates the alignment of synthetic, culturally-grounded personas with established frameworks, specifically the World Values Survey (WVS), the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map, and Moral Foundations Theory. We conceptualize and produce LLM-generated personas based on a set of interpretable WVS-derived variables, and we examine the generated personas through three complementary lenses: positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map, which unveils their interpretation reflecting stable differences across cultural conditionings; demographic-level consistency with the World Values Survey, where response distributions broadly track human group patterns; and moral profiles derived from a Moral Foundations questionnaire, which we analyze through a culture-to-morality mapping to characterize how moral responses vary across different cultural configurations. Our approach of culturally-grounded persona generation and analysis enables evaluation of cross-cultural structure and moral variation.

### [11] [Bifocal Attention: Harmonizing Geometric and Spectral Positional Embeddings for Algorithmic Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22402)
*Kanishk Awadhiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation of standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), called Spectral Rigidity, and proposes Bifocal Attention with Geometric Eyes and Spectral Eyes, plus a Spectral Evolution training protocol, to better capture long-range recursive and algorithmic structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RoPE uses a fixed geometric frequency decay that is good for local syntactic coherence but poorly suited for modeling long-range, periodic, and recursive structures, causing a structure gap where models can’t generalize from shallow to deep reasoning chains.

Method: Introduce Bifocal Attention, which separates positional encoding into Geometric Eyes (standard RoPE for local token interactions) and Spectral Eyes (learnable harmonic operators for recursive depth). Propose Spectral Evolution, a training procedure that starts with geometric frequencies and lets them evolve via gradient descent into an optimized harmonic basis for the task’s algorithmic structure.

Result: From the abstract alone, explicit empirical results are not stated, but the implication is that the proposed method better captures long-range recursive dependencies and improves extrapolation to deeper reasoning steps relative to standard RoPE.

Conclusion: Decoupling positional information into geometric and spectral components, and allowing positional frequencies to evolve during training, addresses the Spectral Rigidity of RoPE and narrows the structure gap in algorithmic and recursive reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become the standard for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their ability to encode relative positions through geometric rotation. However, we identify a significant limitation we term ''Spectral Rigidity'': standard RoPE utilizes a fixed geometric decay ($θ^{-i}$) optimized for local syntactic coherence, which fails to capture the long-range, periodic structures inherent in recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning. This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth. We propose a novel training protocol, Spectral Evolution, which initializes positional frequencies as static geometric parameters but allows them to evolve via gradient descent into a harmonic basis optimized for the specific algorithmic topology of the task.

### [12] [Word-Centered Semantic Graphs for Interpretable Diachronic Sense Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22410)
*Imene Kolli,Kai-Robin Lange,Jonas Rieger,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an interpretable graph-based framework for tracking how word meanings change over time using diachronic corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to semantic shift often rely on opaque embedding-space distances or predefined sense inventories, making it hard to interpret how and why word senses evolve. The authors want a transparent, word-centered representation that reveals polysemy dynamics and sense evolution directly from corpora, without external sense lists.

Method: For each target word and time slice, they construct a word-centered semantic network (graph). Nodes represent context words or substitutes; edges encode a combination of (i) distributional similarity derived from diachronic Skip-gram word embeddings and (ii) lexical substitutability estimated with time-specific masked language models. They then (1) cluster the peripheral region of each graph to identify sense-related communities, (2) align these clusters across time slices based on node overlap, and (3) quantify semantic change using measures such as cluster composition changes and normalized cluster mass over time.

Result: On a New York Times Magazine corpus (1980–2017), they demonstrate that the connectivity patterns of these graphs correlate with polysemy and its evolution. The discovered communities surface distinct semantic change patterns: event-driven sense replacement for "trump", stable meaning with over-fragmented clustering for "god", and slow, communication-technology-related association shifts for "post".

Conclusion: Word-centered semantic graphs combining embeddings and masked language models provide a compact, interpretable tool for tracking and visualizing sense evolution in diachronic text, avoiding dependence on predefined sense inventories and supporting qualitative analysis of different semantic shift types.

Abstract: We propose an interpretable, graph-based framework for analyzing semantic shift in diachronic corpora. For each target word and time slice, we induce a word-centered semantic network that integrates distributional similarity from diachronic Skip-gram embeddings with lexical substitutability from time-specific masked language models. We identify sense-related structure by clustering the peripheral graph, align clusters across time via node overlap, and track change through cluster composition and normalized cluster mass. In an application study on a corpus of New York Times Magazine articles (1980 - 2017), we show that graph connectivity reflects polysemy dynamics and that the induced communities capture contrasting trajectories: event-driven sense replacement (trump), semantic stability with cluster over-segmentation effects (god), and gradual association shifts tied to digital communication (post). Overall, word-centered semantic graphs offer a compact and transparent representation for exploring sense evolution without relying on predefined sense inventories.

### [13] [Large Language Model Agents Are Not Always Faithful Self-Evolvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22436)
*Weixiang Zhao,Yingshuo Wang,Yichen Zhang,Yang Deng,Yanyan Zhao,Wanxiang Che,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They study whether self-evolving LLM agents truly base their decisions on stored experience and find they rely strongly on raw logs but often ignore or misuse condensed summaries of experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-evolving LLM agents are supposed to continually improve by storing and reusing experience, but it is unclear if their decisions are actually causally driven by that stored experience, especially when it is compressed or summarized. This uncertainty calls into question the reliability and design of current self-improving LLM agent frameworks.

Method: They define and measure "experience faithfulness"—the causal dependence of agent behavior on supplied experience—using controlled causal interventions. They systematically manipulate both raw and condensed experience fed to agents and observe behavioral changes. The evaluation spans four representative self-evolving frameworks, ten different LLM backbones, and nine task environments, in both single- and multi-agent setups.

Result: Agents show strong causal dependence on raw experience logs but frequently ignore, underuse, or misinterpret condensed (summarized or abstracted) experience, even when it is their only available experience signal. This asymmetry is robust across model scales, frameworks, and both single- and multi-agent settings. They further identify three contributing factors behind this: (1) condensed experience often loses essential semantics, (2) agents have internal processing biases that downweight or suppress experiential input, and (3) for some tasks the pretrained model priors already suffice, reducing reliance on experience.

Conclusion: Current self-evolving LLM agents are not reliably faithful to condensed experience, undermining a key assumption behind many memory and experience-reuse strategies. To build more dependable self-improving systems, future work must develop mechanisms and representations that preserve semantic fidelity in condensed experience and ensure that agents actually condition their behavior on the experiences they store and reuse.

Abstract: Self-evolving large language model (LLM) agents continually improve by accumulating and reusing past experience, yet it remains unclear whether they faithfully rely on that experience to guide their behavior. We present the first systematic investigation of experience faithfulness, the causal dependence of an agent's decisions on the experience it is given, in self-evolving LLM agents. Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration.

### [14] [Stop Jostling: Adaptive Negative Sampling Reduces the Marginalization of Low-Resource Language Tokens by Cross-Entropy Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22439)
*Galim Turumtaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper tackles poor performance of neural language models on low-resource languages by focusing on rare-token training dynamics and proposing a thresholding method on negative sampling/marginalization to better train rare tokens, showing improved validation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural language models underperform on low-resource languages primarily because their tokens appear infrequently in training data, making them rare and poorly represented. Existing training procedures using marginalization and negative sampling tend to disproportionately hurt these rare tokens, preventing them from learning good representations. The authors want to understand and mitigate this bias so that underrepresented languages can benefit more from modern language modeling techniques.

Method: They analyze how rare tokens are affected by marginalization during training with negative sampling, identifying that these tokens are overly suppressed. To counter this, they introduce a thresholding technique that limits or reduces the marginalization effect beyond a certain point, effectively constraining how strongly negative sampling can push down on rare-token probabilities. They implement and test this within a character-level language model training setup.

Result: In experiments on low-resource language validation sets, the thresholding method leads to significantly better performance compared to standard training without this modification. The empirical results show that rare-token representations are improved and that language modeling metrics (e.g., validation loss/perplexity) on underrepresented languages are meaningfully reduced.

Conclusion: Thresholding the marginalization effect in negative sampling is an effective, simple modification for improving representations of rare tokens in neural language models, especially for low-resource languages. This provides an initial, demonstrable approach for reducing the harmful impact of excessive marginalization on rare tokens and indicates that more careful treatment of negative samples can substantially enhance language modeling for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Neural language models often struggle with low-resource languages due to the limited availability of training data, making tokens from these languages rare in the training set. This paper addresses a specific challenge during training: rare tokens are disproportionately affected by marginalization, which prevents them from learning effectively. We propose a thresholding technique that reduces the impact of this marginalization, allowing rare tokens to benefit from more meaningful alignment. Through experiments with a character-level language model, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves performance on low-resource language validation data. This work is the first to show how negative sampling can be applied to improve the representation of rare tokens by limiting the harmful influence of excessive marginalization, offering a new approach to enhancing language model performance for underrepresented languages.

### [15] [SSL: Sweet Spot Learning for Differentiated Guidance in Agentic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22491)
*Jinyang Wu,Changpeng Yang,Yuhao Shen,Fangzhi Xu,Bolin Ni,Chonghua Liao,Yuchen Liu,Hongzhen Wang,Shuai Nie,Shuai Zhang,Haoran Luo,Jiaming Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Sweet Spot Learning (SSL), a reinforcement learning framework that uses progressive, tiered rewards to better guide agents toward high-quality solutions, improving sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL with verifiable rewards often uses binary rewards (success/fail), which cannot distinguish between trajectories that all reach the same outcome but differ in quality (e.g., efficiency, proximity, partial progress). This loses useful signal about the structure and diversity of the solution space, limiting learning efficiency and the ability to find particularly good or robust solutions. The paper is motivated by the need for a more nuanced, graded reward mechanism that still remains verifiable but can better guide optimization within the space of successful behaviors.

Method: They propose Sweet Spot Learning (SSL), inspired by the “sweet spot” in tennis, where hitting the ball in a specific region yields particularly good effects. SSL designs rewards as progressively amplified, tiered signals that guide policies toward this sweet-spot region of the solution space. The framework adapts to different task types: in visual perception/GUI tasks it uses distance-tiered rewards based on how close the agent’s output is to the target; in complex reasoning and planning tasks it provides incremental rewards for partial progress toward promising solutions. The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing that SSL preserves the ordering of optimal solutions while improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thus making optimization more directed and stable.

Result: Across 12 benchmarks spanning GUI perception, short- and long-horizon planning, and complex reasoning tasks, SSL consistently outperforms strong baseline methods that rely on standard binary or less-structured rewards. The approach achieves up to 2.5× gains in sample efficiency and demonstrates effective transferability of learned behaviors or reward structures across tasks, indicating that the sweet-spot reward shaping generalizes beyond specific domains.

Conclusion: SSL is presented as a general and principled framework for reward design in RL with verifiable signals. By using tiered, progressively amplified rewards that highlight high-quality regions of the solution space, SSL improves optimization quality, sample efficiency, and robustness across a broad range of tasks. The authors conclude that sweet-spot style reward design can serve as a unifying principle for training more capable and general-purpose RL agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training intelligent agents. However, existing methods typically employ binary rewards that fail to capture quality differences among trajectories achieving identical outcomes, thereby overlooking potential diversity within the solution space. Inspired by the ``sweet spot'' concept in tennis-the racket's core region that produces optimal hitting effects, we introduce \textbf{S}weet \textbf{S}pot \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SSL}), a novel framework that provides differentiated guidance for agent optimization. SSL follows a simple yet effective principle: progressively amplified, tiered rewards guide policies toward the sweet-spot region of the solution space. This principle naturally adapts across diverse tasks: visual perception tasks leverage distance-tiered modeling to reward proximity, while complex reasoning tasks reward incremental progress toward promising solutions. We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability. Our work establishes SSL as a general principle for training capable and robust agents.

### [16] [Mock Worlds, Real Skills: Building Small Agentic Language Models with Synthetic Tasks, Simulated Environments, and Rubric-Based Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22511)
*Yuan-Jay Lü,Chengyu Wang,Lei Shen,Jun Huang,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SYNTHAGENT is a framework that synthetically generates diverse tool-use tasks, environments, and rewards so that small LLMs can be trained via reinforcement learning to gain strong agentic capabilities, often surpassing larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small LLMs lag behind large models in complex agentic behavior, and existing RL training is constrained by limited, easy open-source datasets and unstable, low-diversity real-world APIs that hinder scalable rollouts.

Method: Use a strong teacher model to synthesize new tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrite them into underspecified instructions that force clarification queries. Pair this with an LLM-based user simulator exposing private info, a mock tool system providing stable tool responses, and task-level reward rubrics derived from subgoals, interactions, and forbidden behaviors.

Result: Across 14 difficult benchmarks in math, search, and tool use, models trained with SYNTHAGENT’s synthetic data show large performance improvements; notably, small models trained this way can outperform larger baseline models that were not trained with the framework.

Conclusion: Carefully designed synthetic environments, tools, and reward structures can overcome key data and API bottlenecks in RL for agents, enabling small LLMs to acquire strong agentic capabilities that rival or exceed those of larger models at much lower cost.

Abstract: Small LLMs often struggle to match the agentic capabilities of large, costly models. While reinforcement learning can help, progress has been limited by two structural bottlenecks: existing open-source agentic training data are narrow in task variety and easily solved; real-world APIs lack diversity and are unstable for large-scale reinforcement learning rollout processes. We address these challenges with SYNTHAGENT, a framework that jointly synthesizes diverse tool-use training data and simulates complete environments. Specifically, a strong teacher model creates novel tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into intentionally underspecified instructions. This compels agents to actively query users for missing details. When handling synthetic tasks, an LLM-based user simulator provides user-private information, while a mock tool system delivers stable tool responses. For rewards, task-level rubrics are constructed based on required subgoals, user-agent interactions, and forbidden behaviors. Across 14 challenging datasets in math, search, and tool use, models trained on our synthetic data achieve substantial gains, with small models outperforming larger baselines.

### [17] [One Ring to Rule Them All: Unifying Group-Based RL via Dynamic Power-Mean Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22521)
*Weisong Zhao,Tong Wang,Zichang Tan,Te Yang,Siran Peng,Haoyuan Zhang,Tianshuo Zhang,Haichao Shi,Meng Meng,Yang Yang,Xiangyu Zhu,Zhen Lei,Xiao-Yu Zhang,Xu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized group-based reinforcement learning framework that unifies GRPO and GMPO by parameterizing the aggregation geometry with a power-mean exponent p, and adaptively chooses p via a clip-aware effective sample size mechanism to improve stability and performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group-based reinforcement learning methods like GRPO (arithmetic mean) and GMPO (geometric mean) use fixed aggregation geometries for combining trajectory information, which do not adapt to the evolving and heterogeneous nature of trajectories. This rigidity limits their ability to balance aggressive learning on reliable trajectories with conservative updates on unstable ones. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by creating a more flexible, adaptive aggregation mechanism.

Method: The authors propose Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), which introduces a power-mean geometry exponent p to parameterize the aggregation of trajectory gradients, generalizing GRPO and GMPO as special cases. They analyze how varying p changes the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens according to their advantages. To adapt p automatically, they design a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism: they define a deterministic rule that maps the fraction of clipped trajectory samples to a target ESS, and then solve for the p that makes the ESS of the current trajectory match this target. This lets the algorithm shift between more aggressive (arithmetic-like) and more conservative (geometric-like) behavior depending on trajectory reliability.

Result: Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, PMPO achieves better performance than strong baseline methods, including existing group-based RL approaches like GRPO and GMPO. Empirically, PMPO demonstrates improved stability and learning efficiency, showing that adaptive control of the aggregation geometry leads to more effective gradient updates.

Conclusion: PMPO provides a unified and extensible framework for group-based reinforcement learning by viewing GRPO and GMPO as instances of a broader power-mean–based family. By adaptively choosing the power-mean exponent p using a clip-aware ESS criterion, PMPO can dynamically adjust between aggressive and conservative update regimes according to trajectory reliability, leading to superior performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. The approach suggests that flexible aggregation geometries are key to better stability and efficiency in group-based RL for reasoning models.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning has evolved from the arithmetic mean of GRPO to the geometric mean of GMPO. While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.

### [18] [$ρ$-$\texttt{EOS}$: Training-free Bidirectional Variable-Length Control for Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22527)
*Jingyi Yang,Yuxian Jiang,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ρ-EOS, a training-free strategy that enables masked diffusion LLMs to generate sequences with variable length in a single denoising stage, using the implicit density of EOS tokens as a signal to expand or contract masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion LLMs currently require a fixed, predefined generation length. This rigidity causes a trade-off: long lengths ensure quality but waste computation and tokens; short lengths are efficient but risk truncation and poor outputs. The authors want a way to let these models flexibly adjust sequence length during inference without retraining.

Method: They analyze the denoising process and observe that the model’s implicit probability (density) of EOS tokens over masked positions correlates with whether the current allocated length is too long or too short. They then design ρ-EOS, a training-free inference procedure that tracks this EOS density at each denoising step. If the density becomes too high, it indicates over-allocation of tokens, so the method contracts the number of MASK tokens; if it is too low, it expands them. This dynamic adjustment happens bidirectionally within a single masked denoising trajectory, unlike prior two-stage, unidirectional methods.

Result: On math and code benchmarks, ρ-EOS preserves task performance (i.e., accuracy and solution quality) while significantly reducing inference cost and improving how effectively tokens are used, compared to fixed-length and earlier variable-length methods.

Conclusion: Implicit EOS token density can serve as a robust internal signal for length sufficiency in masked diffusion LLMs. Leveraging this, ρ-EOS provides a simple, training-free, single-stage mechanism for bidirectional variable-length generation that maintains performance while improving efficiency and token utilization.

Abstract: Beyond parallel generation and global context modeling, current masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) suffer from a fundamental limitation: they require a predefined, fixed generation length, which lacks flexibility and forces an inevitable trade-off between output quality and computational efficiency. To address this, we study the denoising dynamics and find that the implicit density ($ρ$) of end-of-sequence ($\texttt{EOS}$) tokens serves as a reliable signal of generation sufficiency. In particular, the evolving implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\textbf{$ρ$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\textbf{$ρ$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion. Extensive experiments on mathematics and code benchmarks demonstrate that $\textbf{$ρ$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves comparable performance while substantially improving inference efficiency and token utilization.

### [19] [Towards the Holographic Characteristic of LLMs for Efficient Short-text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22546)
*Shun Qian,Bingquan Liu,Chengjie Sun,Zhen Xu,Baoxun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new "Holographic Characteristic" in LLMs where target-side keywords appear early in generation, and introduces HOLO, a plugin that extracts these early keywords and uses parallel lexically constrained generation to produce short texts as efficiently and effectively as standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLMs’ in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning are well studied, their concrete generation dynamics—how outputs unfold over time—are less explored. Understanding specific traits underlying their strong generative power could both deepen theory and improve inference efficiency. The authors aim to uncover and exploit such a trait.

Method: 1) Empirically analyze generation traces of various LLMs to observe that key target-side words often appear in the initial decoding steps. They term this the "Holographic Characteristic." 2) Design HOLO, a plugin that, within a small number of decoding steps, queries the LLM to extract candidate target-side keywords. 3) Feed these keywords into a parallel lexically constrained text generation algorithm that completes the sentence while respecting the keyword constraints. 4) Evaluate HOLO on multiple LLMs of different architectures and sizes on short-text generation benchmarks, using both automatic metrics and human evaluation, and compare with standard generation baselines.

Result: Across extensive experiments, HOLO’s generated short texts achieve performance similar to or on par with baseline generation strategies under both automatic and human evaluation. HOLO maintains quality while potentially improving inference efficiency by leveraging early keyword extraction and parallel constrained generation.

Conclusion: Language models display a "Holographic Characteristic" where essential target-side keywords emerge very early in the generation process. This property can be operationalized via the HOLO plugin, which first extracts early keywords and then completes the text using parallel lexically constrained generation. Experiments in short-text generation show that HOLO can match baseline quality while indicating the promise of exploiting this characteristic for more efficient inference and a deeper understanding of LLM generation behavior.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted interest in exploring their in-context learning abilities and chain-of-thought capabilities. However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.

### [20] [Are LLM Evaluators Really Narcissists? Sanity Checking Self-Preference Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22548)
*Dani Roytburg,Matthew Bozoukov,Matthew Nguyen,Mackenzie Puig-Hall,Narmeen Oozeer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and corrects a core methodological confound in measuring self-preference ("narcissism") of LLM judges, proposing an Evaluator Quality Baseline that drastically reduces measurement error and shows many prior self-bias findings may be overstated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work suggests LLMs acting as judges prefer their own answers, but it's unclear how much of this is true self-preference versus artifacts from the evaluation setup, especially when judges themselves often answer hard queries incorrectly. This undermines automated training and evaluation pipelines that rely on LLM judges.

Method: The authors analyze evaluation setups and identify a key confound: judges are likelier to issue self-preferring verdicts when they themselves got the query wrong, independent of real self-bias. They propose an Evaluator Quality Baseline that estimates how often a judge incorrectly favors its own answer compared to how often it incorrectly favors another model's wrong answer. They apply this baseline to a large dataset of 37,448 judged queries and examine the entropy patterns of votes on easy vs. hard items.

Result: Using the Evaluator Quality Baseline reduces estimated measurement error by up to 89.6%, and when controlling for this confound only about 51% of originally reported self-preference effects remain statistically significant. They also characterize how vote entropy differs between easy and hard evaluations.

Conclusion: Many previously measured LLM self-preference effects may be significantly inflated by a fundamental methodological confound. Their Evaluator Quality Baseline offers a simple corrective that filters out noisy judgments on hard problems, enabling more accurate study of self-preference and contributing to broader efforts to map and isolate biases in LLM-based evaluation systems.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLM) favor own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.

### [21] [SpanNorm: Reconciling Training Stability and Performance in Deep Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22580)
*Chao Wang,Bei Li,Jiaqi Zhang,Xinyu Liu,Yuchun Fan,Linkun Lyu,Xin Chen,Jingang Wang,Tong Xiao,Peng Pei,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpanNorm is a new Transformer normalization scheme that combines the stability advantages of PreNorm with the performance benefits of PostNorm for training deep LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Transformers with LLM-scale depth suffer from a trade-off between stability and performance depending on whether normalization is applied before (PreNorm) or after (PostNorm) the residual block. PreNorm trains stably but can degrade performance and cause representation collapse in very deep networks, whereas PostNorm can achieve higher quality but is prone to gradient explosion/vanishing and instability. There is a need for a normalization design that preserves stable signal propagation while still enabling the strong optimization properties of PostNorm.

Method: The authors introduce SpanNorm, a Transformer block design where the residual connection is made to span the entire block, forming a clean long skip path for stable signal propagation. Inside the block, they use a PostNorm-style normalization on the aggregated output rather than on the input, thus retaining performance benefits. They pair this structural change with a theoretically motivated scaling strategy that controls variance growth across depth. They analyze signal variance through layers to show boundedness and examine gradient behavior to understand why SpanNorm avoids the pathologies of both pure PreNorm and pure PostNorm.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that with appropriate scaling, SpanNorm maintains bounded signal variance across the network depth, preventing gradient explosion/vanishing issues typical of PostNorm and mitigating representation collapse issues present in deep PreNorm models. Empirically, across both standard dense Transformer models and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants, SpanNorm leads to more stable training and better performance metrics compared with conventional PreNorm and PostNorm baselines.

Conclusion: SpanNorm provides a principled architectural and normalization modification that reconciles the stability–performance trade-off between PreNorm and PostNorm in deep Transformers. By combining a long-range residual connection with PostNorm-style output normalization and proper scaling, it yields bounded signal propagation, improved gradient behavior, and consistently superior empirical results. This suggests SpanNorm as a strong default choice for training more powerful and stable LLMs, including MoE architectures.

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on the stable training of deep Transformer architectures. A critical design choice is the placement of normalization layers, leading to a fundamental trade-off: the ``PreNorm'' architecture ensures training stability at the cost of potential performance degradation in deep models, while the ``PostNorm'' architecture offers strong performance but suffers from severe training instability. In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.

### [22] [Language Model Circuits Are Sparse in the Neuron Basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22594)
*Aryaman Arora,Zhengxuan Wu,Jacob Steinhardt,Sarah Schwettmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They show ordinary MLP neurons in language models already form a sparse, interpretable feature basis comparable to sparse autoencoders, and use this to trace and causally intervene on circuits without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability methods often assume important features are distributed across many neurons, motivating sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features. But training SAEs is computationally expensive and may introduce artifacts. The authors want to know whether the existing MLP neuron basis is already sufficiently sparse and interpretable to support circuit tracing and mechanistic analysis, avoiding SAE training.

Method: 1) Empirically compare the sparsity and feature structure of MLP neurons to features learned by sparse autoencoders, showing they are similarly sparse as a basis.
2) Build an end-to-end circuit-tracing pipeline that operates directly on MLP neurons, using gradient-based attribution methods to identify neurons that are causally involved in specific behaviors.
3) Apply this pipeline to multiple benchmarks, particularly subject-verb agreement and a multi-hop reasoning task, and perform causal interventions (e.g., ablating or steering neuron activations) to test control over model behavior.

Result: They find that MLP neurons, without any auxiliary training, are as sparse a feature basis as SAE-derived features. Using only about 100 MLP neurons, they can largely determine behavior on a subject-verb agreement benchmark. In a multi-hop geographic reasoning task, they identify small sets of neurons corresponding to specific latent reasoning substeps like mapping cities to states, and show that manipulating these neurons can change the model’s output.

Conclusion: Contrary to the prevailing view that raw neurons are too entangled to interpret, MLP neurons in language models already form a sparse, interpretable basis comparable to SAEs for mechanistic interpretability tasks. This enables end-to-end, gradient-based circuit tracing directly in neuron space, giving causal control over model behavior on nontrivial tasks, and removes the need for extra SAE training costs for many interpretability applications.

Abstract: The high-level concepts that a neural network uses to perform computation need not be aligned to individual neurons (Smolensky, 1986). Language model interpretability research has thus turned to techniques such as \textit{sparse autoencoders} (SAEs) to decompose the neuron basis into more interpretable units of model computation, for tasks such as \textit{circuit tracing}. However, not all neuron-based representations are uninterpretable. For the first time, we empirically show that \textbf{MLP neurons are as sparse a feature basis as SAEs}. We use this finding to develop an end-to-end pipeline for circuit tracing on the MLP neuron basis, which locates causal circuitry on a variety of tasks using gradient-based attribution. On a standard subject-verb agreement benchmark (Marks et al., 2025), a circuit of $\approx 10^2$ MLP neurons is enough to control model behaviour. On the multi-hop city $\to$ state $\to$ capital task from Lindsey et al., 2025, we find a circuit in which small sets of neurons encode specific latent reasoning steps (e.g.~`map city to its state'), and can be steered to change the model's output. This work thus advances automated interpretability of language models without additional training costs.

### [23] [Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling: Diverse Generation for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22629)
*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Yiqiao Huang,Ivor Tsang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how the temporal structure of diffusion language models can be used to control and improve diversity in text generation, and introduces a training-free sampling method (TAPS) that boosts diverse yet fluent and instruction-following outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models add a time dimension to text generation, but it is not well understood how different denoising steps affect semantics vs. surface form, nor how to exploit this to systematically generate multiple plausible semantic or reasoning paths without hurting quality.

Method: The authors empirically analyze the denoising trajectory of Diffusion-LMs and identify a temporal division of labor: early steps govern global semantics, later steps handle local lexical refinements. Based on this, they design Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference schedule that injects stronger perturbations during early diffusion steps to induce semantic branching, then gradually reduces perturbation strength in later steps to maintain fluency and adherence to instructions. TAPS is applied on both non-autoregressive and semi-autoregressive diffusion language backbones (LLaDA and TraDo).

Result: On creative writing and reasoning benchmarks, applying TAPS to Diffusion-LMs consistently yields more diverse outputs (in terms of semantics and reasoning paths) while maintaining or not degrading standard measures of generation quality, fluency, and instruction following. The approach works across different diffusion architectures (LLaDA and TraDo).

Conclusion: Temporal dynamics in Diffusion-LMs can be exploited to control semantic diversity: early diffusion steps shape global meaning and are ideal for branching, while later steps polish wording. The proposed TAPS sampling method is a simple, training-free way to harness this principle, providing a practical tool to increase diversity in diffusion-based text generation without sacrificing quality or instruction adherence.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (Diffusion-LMs) introduce an explicit temporal dimension into text generation, yet how this structure can be leveraged to control generation diversity for exploring multiple valid semantic or reasoning paths remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that Diffusion-LMs, like diffusion models in image generation, exhibit a temporal division of labor: early denoising steps largely determine the global semantic structure, while later steps focus on local lexical refinement. Building on this insight, we propose Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference strategy that encourages semantic branching early in the diffusion process while progressively reducing perturbations to preserve fluency and instruction adherence. TAPS is compatible with both non-autoregressive and semi-autoregressive Diffusion backbones, demonstrated on LLaDA and TraDo in our paper, and consistently improves output diversity across creative writing and reasoning benchmarks without compromising generation quality.

### [24] [DART-ing Through the Drift: Dynamic Tracing of Knowledge Neurons for Adaptive Inference-Time Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22632)
*Abhishek Tyagi,Yunuo Cen,Shrey Dhorajiya,Bharadwaj Veeravalli,Xuanyao Fong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DART, a dynamic, data-free, attention-guided pruning method for LLM feed-forward layers that adapts masks at runtime and preserves accuracy under high sparsity with tiny overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have substantial parameter redundancy, especially in FFNs, making them expensive to run. Existing pruning methods are static and require calibration data, leading to data dependence, computational overhead, and inability to adapt to changing contextual knowledge during autoregressive generation.

Method: DART is a lightweight, training-free, dynamic pruning framework. It traces attention score distributions during inference to detect context changes and updates neuron-level masks in FFNs on the fly. Neurons deemed salient under the current context are retained, while others are pruned, enabling context-based sparsity without offline calibration or retraining.

Result: On LLAMA-3.1-8B, DART achieves up to 14.5% accuracy improvement over prior dynamic pruning baselines at 70% FFN sparsity across ten benchmarks. On summarization tasks, it yields up to 3x better ROUGE-L than static-mask pruning and performance comparable to the dense model, while adding only 0.1% FLOPs overhead and using <10 MB extra memory on a 16 GB model.

Conclusion: Dynamic, attention-guided runtime pruning can effectively exploit redundancy in LLM FFNs without training or calibration data, adapting to evolving semantic contexts during generation. DART maintains or closely matches dense-model performance across general and domain-specific tasks, even at high sparsity, with negligible overhead, offering a practical way to make LLM inference more efficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial parameter redundancy, particularly in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead.

### [25] [NAG: A Unified Native Architecture for Encoder-free Text-Graph Modeling in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22657)
*Haisong Gong,Zhibo Liu,Qiang Liu,Shu Wu,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes NAG, a unified architecture that lets language models natively process graph structure and text without external GNNs, by modifying self-attention and positional encodings to encode topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LM+GNN approaches treat graph structure and text separately, requiring complex alignment between graph embeddings and language tokens, which can be conceptually messy and potentially inefficient for text-graph tasks. The authors want a simpler, more coherent way to let LMs directly understand graph topology alongside textual content.

Method: They introduce NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), which internalizes graph processing into the LM itself. NAG reuses the LM’s self-attention mechanism to enforce graph topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs so that structurally equivalent nodes are treated consistently. Two implementations are described: NAG-Zero, which minimally alters the base LM to preserve its language abilities, and NAG-LoRA, which uses parameter-efficient adaptation (LoRA-style) to better fit structural information.

Result: Across multiple and diverse graph-related tasks, NAG-based models show strong graph understanding performance, matching or surpassing approaches that rely on separate GNN encoders, while avoiding their computational and architectural overhead.

Conclusion: Language models can natively model graph structure if their attention patterns and positional encodings are appropriately adapted, removing the need for external GNNs. NAG provides a simpler, unified, and effective paradigm for text-graph modeling that maintains linguistic ability while gaining robust graph comprehension.

Abstract: Prevailing methods for integrating graphs into Language Models (LMs) typically rely on a segregated architecture: external Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode structural topology, while LMs process textual semantics. We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.

### [26] [TSLM: Tree-Structured Language Modeling for Divergent Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22688)
*Doyoung Kim,Jaehyeok Doo,Minjoon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Tree-Structured Language Modeling (TSLM), allowing language models to represent and explore multiple reasoning branches within a single generation, improving efficiency and robustness compared to external search methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential generation in current language models forces them to follow one reasoning path at a time, making exploration inefficient and entangled. External search methods like tree search require many separate forward passes. The authors are motivated to design a model that can natively represent branching reasoning structures, reuse shared prefixes, and learn systematic exploration directly from data.

Method: They introduce TSLM, which augments language models with special tokens that explicitly encode tree branching and structure. The model is trained on full search trees comprising both successful and failed reasoning paths, treating them as tree-structured traces. This lets the model generate and selectively expand multiple branches in a single forward trajectory, sharing computation across common prefixes.

Result: TSLM achieves robust reasoning performance while significantly improving inference efficiency because it avoids multiple independent forward passes typical of external search-based methods. The model can perform systematic exploration internally, leveraging its tree-structured generative process.

Conclusion: Supervised learning on fully tree-structured reasoning traces enables language models to internalize search and exploration more efficiently than external search procedures. TSLM demonstrates a promising new inference-time scaling paradigm, where a single model generation can manage and expand a search tree, leading to more robust and efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Language models generate reasoning sequentially, preventing them from decoupling irrelevant exploration paths during search. We introduce Tree-Structured Language Modeling (TSLM), which uses special tokens to encode branching structure, enabling models to generate and selectively expand multiple search paths within a single generation process. By training on complete search trees including both successful and failed attempts, TSLM learns to internalize systematic exploration without redundant recomputation of shared prefixes. TSLM achieves robust performance and superior inference efficiency by avoiding the multiple independent forward passes required by external search methods. These results suggest a new paradigm of inference-time scaling for robust reasoning, demonstrating that supervised learning on complete tree-structured traces provides an efficient alternative for developing systematic exploration capabilities in language models.

### [27] [FNF: Functional Network Fingerprint for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22692)
*Yiheng Liu,Junhao Ning,Sichen Xia,Haiyang Sun,Yang Yang,Hanyang Chi,Xiaohui Gao,Ning Qiang,Bao Ge,Junwei Han,Xintao Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method to verify if a suspect LLM is derived from a protected model by comparing internal activity patterns, robust to fine-tuning and other modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are expensive to develop and have high commercial value, but open-source releases can be misappropriated. Existing IP protection and model-provenance methods are limited, often data-hungry, intrusive, or fragile to model changes. There is a need for a simple, non-invasive, and robust way to check whether a suspect model is derived from a given LLM to protect developers' intellectual property.

Method: They introduce Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), which compares the functional network activity of a victim and a suspect LLM. Without additional training, they feed both models diverse input samples and analyze consistency in patterns of neuron activations across the network (the "functional network"). Models sharing a common origin, even when differing in scale or architecture, exhibit aligned activation patterns; unrelated models do not. The method is designed to work with few samples, and they test its robustness to common model modifications such as fine-tuning, pruning, parameter permutation, and variations in architecture/dimensionality.

Result: Empirically, models that are derived from a common source show highly consistent functional activity patterns across samples, enabling reliable detection of lineage. Independently trained models on different data or objectives fail to preserve such alignment, allowing FNF to distinguish them. The approach maintains model utility, requires only a small number of samples for verification, and remains robust under fine-tuning, pruning, parameter permutation, and across diverse model architectures and sizes.

Conclusion: Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF) is an effective, training-free, and sample-efficient tool for verifying whether a suspect LLM originates from a protected model by comparing internal activation patterns. It is non-invasive, preserves model performance, and is robust to common modifications and architectural differences, making it a practical mechanism for large language model intellectual property protection.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) is costly and has significant commercial value. Consequently, preventing unauthorized appropriation of open-source LLMs and protecting developers' intellectual property rights have become critical challenges. In this work, we propose the Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method for detecting whether a suspect LLM is derived from a victim model, based on the consistency between their functional network activity. We demonstrate that models that share a common origin, even with differences in scale or architecture, exhibit highly consistent patterns of neuronal activity within their functional networks across diverse input samples. In contrast, models trained independently on distinct data or with different objectives fail to preserve such activity alignment. Unlike conventional approaches, our method requires only a few samples for verification, preserves model utility, and remains robust to common model modifications (such as fine-tuning, pruning, and parameter permutation), as well as to comparisons across diverse architectures and dimensionalities. FNF thus provides model owners and third parties with a simple, non-invasive, and effective tool for protecting LLM intellectual property.

### [28] [Models Know Models Best: Evaluation via Model-Preferred Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22699)
*Joonhak Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jongyeon Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that large language models perform differently on multiple-choice questions depending on whether they are evaluated in symbol-based or cloze-style formats, and proposes a dynamic method to choose the best format per question, improving zero-shot accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of LLMs on multiple-choice benchmarks often yields inconsistent or misleading results because the choice of input/output format (symbol-based options vs. cloze-style continuations) interacts strongly with model behavior, obscuring their true capabilities. There is a need to systematically understand and correct these format-induced discrepancies.

Method: The authors compare LLM performance on symbol-based versus cloze-style multiple-choice tasks across various decoder-based models, analyze how task characteristics interact with evaluation format, and identify that likelihood-based scoring favors natural language continuations while explicit comparison favors symbol selection. They then design a dynamic format-alignment strategy using a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals (derived from the LLM itself rather than human heuristics) to automatically choose the preferred format per problem instance.

Result: They find consistent, model-agnostic discrepancies in performance between symbol-based and cloze-style formats. The proposed dynamic alignment strategy, driven by model-generated preference signals, yields substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy on both reasoning and knowledge benchmarks compared to static formats and human-designed heuristics.

Conclusion: Evaluation format has a systematic and significant impact on LLM multiple-choice performance, but these effects can be leveraged rather than ignored. By learning to align the format of each question with the model’s implicit preferences, one can better expose the model’s latent capabilities and obtain more accurate and higher-performing zero-shot evaluations across benchmarks.

Abstract: Performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multiple-choice tasks differs markedly between symbol-based and cloze-style evaluation formats. The observed discrepancies are systematically attributable to task characteristics: natural language continuation benefits from likelihood scoring, whereas explicit comparison is better suited to symbol-based selection. These trends are consistent across various decoder-based LLMs, indicating model-agnostic effects. To address these inconsistencies, a dynamic format-alignment strategy is introduced that employs a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals. In contrast to human-designed heuristics, which often degrade performance, this approach uses model-generated signals to determine the optimal format for each problem instance. The proposed method achieves substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, better revealing the models' latent capabilities.

### [29] [MM-THEBench: Do Reasoning MLLMs Think Reasonably?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22735)
*Zhidian Huang,Zijun Yao,Ji Qi,Shangqing Tu,Junxian Ma,Jinxin Liu,Weichuan Liu,Xiaoyin Che,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces MM-THEBench, a benchmark to evaluate hallucinations in the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) steps of multimodal reasoning LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-capable multimodal LLMs can “think” via chains-of-thought, but it is unclear whether this reduces hallucinations in perception and reasoning. Existing benchmarks focus on final answers for pre-reasoning models, ignore the internal thinking process, and cannot measure hallucinations that occur during reasoning. There is also evidence that self-reflective reasoning both improves robustness and introduces new hallucinations, and that subtle perceptual errors still propagate to wrong or accidentally correct answers, revealing a gap in current evaluation.

Method: Propose MM-THEBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess hallucinations in the intermediate CoT steps of multimodal reasoning MLLMs. The benchmark includes: (1) a fine-grained, cognition-inspired taxonomy of hallucination types; (2) diverse multimodal data with manually verified reasoning annotations; and (3) a multi-level automated evaluation framework that can score hallucinations across perception and reasoning stages and at different granularities.

Result: Using MM-THEBench, the authors run extensive experiments on several mainstream multimodal reasoning LLMs and quantitatively analyze how different forms of ‘thinking’ impact hallucination rates and reasoning能力 across various multimodal tasks. The benchmark exposes patterns of when and how self-reflective and CoT reasoning help or hurt hallucination and problem-solving performance.

Conclusion: MM-THEBench provides a targeted way to measure and analyze hallucinations in the intermediate reasoning process of multimodal LLMs, filling a gap left by prior benchmarks that only consider final outputs. The findings show nuanced trade-offs: reasoning can both mitigate and introduce hallucinations, depending on task and model, and the proposed taxonomy + evaluation pipeline offers a foundation for developing more reliable multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mark a shift from non-thinking models to post-trained reasoning models capable of solving complex problems through thinking. However, whether such thinking mitigates hallucinations in multimodal perception and reasoning remains unclear. Self-reflective reasoning enhances robustness but introduces additional hallucinations, and subtle perceptual errors still result in incorrect or coincidentally correct answers. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on models before the emergence of reasoning MLLMs, neglecting the internal thinking process and failing to measure the hallucinations that occur during thinking. To address these challenges, we introduce MM-THEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing hallucinations of intermediate CoTs in reasoning MLLMs. MM-THEBench features a fine-grained taxonomy grounded in cognitive dimensions, diverse data with verified reasoning annotations, and a multi-level automated evaluation framework. Extensive experiments on mainstream reasoning MLLMs reveal insights into how thinking affects hallucination and reasoning capability in various multimodal tasks.

### [30] [AR-BENCH: Benchmarking Legal Reasoning with Judgment Error Detection, Classification and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22742)
*Yifei Li,Richong Zhang,Wanyu Tu,Zhijie Nie,Haokun Luo,Chuantao Yin,Pengchong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose a new legal AI task, APPELLATE REVIEW, for detecting and correcting errors in court judgments, and build a benchmark dataset (AR-BENCH) to evaluate models on this task, revealing current models’ weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal judgments can be erroneous because of complex facts and abstract legal rules, while appellate courts are overloaded. Existing legal AI focuses on predicting outcomes or generating texts, which doesn’t match the real need of reviewing already-issued judgments for errors. There is a gap for tools that act like appellate reviewers, detecting anomalies in legal reasoning and applications.

Method: They conceptualize APPELLATE REVIEW as an anomaly-detection style task focused on diagnosing and correcting errors in existing judgments. They build AR-BENCH, a dataset with 8,700 meticulously annotated judicial decisions plus 34,617 related documents as supporting corpora. They then systematically evaluate 14 large language models on this benchmark to measure their diagnostic and error-detection capabilities.

Result: The benchmark and experiments show that current large language models have substantial limitations in identifying and classifying legal application errors in actual judgments. Performance gaps across models highlight weaknesses in diagnostic legal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: APPELLATE REVIEW is proposed as a distinct and practically important legal AI task, different from prediction or generation. AR-BENCH provides the first systematic benchmark for this task. Current models perform poorly on it, indicating that future research must focus on improving diagnostic reliability and error-detection in legal reasoning before such systems can be trusted in appellate review scenarios.

Abstract: Legal judgments may contain errors due to the complexity of case circumstances and the abstract nature of legal concepts, while existing appellate review mechanisms face efficiency pressures from a surge in case volumes. Although current legal AI research focuses on tasks like judgment prediction and legal document generation, the task of judgment review differs fundamentally in its objectives and paradigm: it centers on detecting, classifying, and correcting errors after a judgment is issued, constituting anomaly detection rather than prediction or generation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel task APPELLATE REVIEW, aiming to assess models' diagnostic reasoning and reliability in legal practice. We also construct a novel dataset benchmark AR-BENCH, which comprises 8,700 finely annotated decisions and 34,617 supplementary corpora. By evaluating 14 large language models, we reveal critical limitations in existing models' ability to identify legal application errors, providing empirical evidence for future improvements.

### [31] [RASST: Fast Cross-modal Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22777)
*Jiaxuan Luo,Siqi Ouyang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RASST, a retrieval-augmented framework for simultaneous speech translation that improves rare and domain-specific terminology translation and overall quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simultaneous speech translation with Speech LLMs still struggles with accurate translation of rare and domain-specific terminology, especially under incremental, partial speech input. Existing retrieval-augmentation methods for text MT don't directly fit SST because SST needs fast cross-modal speech-to-text retrieval and dynamic decisions on when to use retrieved terms.

Method: The authors propose RASST, which integrates a lightweight speech-text retriever into the SST pipeline. It uses efficient sliding-window cross-modal retrieval to supply chunk-level terminology hints to the Speech LLM and employs synthesized training data to teach the model how and when to exploit these retrieved terms during incremental generation.

Result: On the ACL 60/60 dev set across three language directions, RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and increases overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points. Ablation studies show that each proposed component contributes to the gains.

Conclusion: Tightly coupling cross-modal retrieval with a Speech LLM in simultaneous speech translation effectively addresses terminology translation issues, yielding substantial gains in both terminology accuracy and overall translation quality.

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SST) produces target text incrementally from partial speech input. Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely. Experiments on three language directions of the ACL 60/60 dev set show that RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and increases overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points, with ablations confirming the contribution of each component.

### [32] [Sparse or Dense? A Mechanistic Estimation of Computation Density in Transformer-based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22795)
*Corentin Kervadec,Iuliia Lysova,Marco Baroni,Gemma Boleda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanistic-interpretability-based estimator of computation density in LLMs and finds that LLMs are generally dense, density is input-dependent, and similar across models, with higher density for rare tokens and shorter contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although many pruning studies suggest that large parts of LLMs can be removed with little loss, implying sparsity or inefficiency, we lack a systematic way to quantify how densely computation is actually used across parameters for different inputs. The authors want to rigorously measure this "computation density" to understand when and where LLMs are sparse or dense, and what factors drive this behavior.

Method: They design a computation density estimator grounded in mechanistic interpretability ideas. This estimator analyzes how much of the model’s computational graph is effectively involved for a given input, enabling per-input and per-model quantification of density. They then apply this estimator across various LLMs and inputs, correlating estimated density with token frequency and context length, and comparing density patterns across different models.

Result: Using the estimator, they find: (1) overall LLM inference is mostly dense, opposing common assumptions from pruning work; (2) the density is dynamic—models switch between sparse and dense regimes depending on the specific input; (3) the per-input density patterns are significantly correlated across different LLMs, indicating that the same prompts tend to provoke similar high or low densities. They also observe that rare tokens tend to require higher density, while increasing context length often lowers density.

Conclusion: The proposed estimator reveals that LLMs typically perform dense rather than sparse computation, but that this density varies predictably with input properties like token rarity and context length, and is consistent across models. This challenges strongly symbolic or rule-based views of LLM processing and offers a new tool for analyzing and potentially optimizing LLM architectures and inference behavior.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.

### [33] [When Meanings Meet: Investigating the Emergence and Quality of Shared Concept Spaces during Multilingual Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22851)
*Felicia Körner,Max Müller-Eberstein,Anna Korhonen,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how language-agnostic concept spaces emerge inside a multilingual LLM during pretraining, using causal interpretability (activation patching) to understand cross-lingual alignment and what translation improvements really mean.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs are crucial for languages with limited monolingual data, and prior work suggests they use shared concept spaces across languages. However, existing studies are mostly correlational, focus only on the final model, and give limited error analysis, so we don’t know how these shared spaces actually emerge during training or how reliably they support translation and cross-lingual transfer.

Method: The authors analyze EuroLLM during different stages of pretraining using activation patching, a causal interpretability technique. They first identify internal representations corresponding to cross-lingual concepts, then inject these activations into a translation prompt to see whether and how translations change, and whether these changes are consistent across languages. They complement this with detailed manual error analysis of the resulting translations.

Result: They find that language-agnostic concept spaces form relatively early in pretraining and become progressively refined, but the degree of alignment with these spaces varies by language. Their interventions sometimes appear to improve translation quality, but closer inspection shows that many changes are shifts in behavior (e.g., choosing different senses of a polysemous word or translating instead of copying homographs) rather than genuine increases in translation accuracy or capability.

Conclusion: Shared cross-lingual concept spaces do emerge and evolve during multilingual LLM pretraining, but their utility and alignment are language-dependent. Moreover, causal interpretability methods like activation patching can be misleading if one equates changes in model output with true quality gains; careful, fine-grained analysis is needed. These insights refine our understanding of cross-lingual alignment dynamics and clarify when causal interpretability yields meaningful conclusions in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with high multilingual coverage is becoming increasingly important -- especially when monolingual resources are scarce. Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability. Our findings offer new insight into the training dynamics of cross-lingual alignment and the conditions under which causal interpretability methods offer meaningful insights in multilingual contexts.

*Elif Sayar,Tolgahan Türker,Anna Golynskaia Knezhevich,Bihter Dereli,Ayşe Demirhas,Lionel Nicolas,Gülşen Eryiğit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose and evaluate a new, semi-automatic, taxonomy-based error annotation framework and tool for Turkish learner corpora, achieving high accuracy and enabling richer analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learner corpora usually use flat, holistic labels that do not separate different linguistic dimensions of an error, which limits the depth, interpretability, and granularity of analyses about why and how learners make errors.

Method: They adopt a recently proposed faceted taxonomy of learner errors and build a semi-automated annotation methodology and extension framework around it. They implement an annotation extender for Turkish that automatically enriches existing flat error labels with additional linguistic and metadata facets from the taxonomy, guided by a manual annotation guideline and refined tagset, and systematically evaluate its facet-level accuracy.

Result: The automatic annotation extender for Turkish achieves a high facet-level accuracy of 95.86% in inferring and adding taxonomy-based facets to existing annotations, producing a taxonomically enriched learner corpus.

Conclusion: A faceted, taxonomy-based, semi-automatic annotation approach can successfully enrich learner corpora beyond flat labels, enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable error analyses. The presented Turkish Learner Corpus, guidelines, tagset, and extender form the first taxonomy-compliant resource of this kind and can guide future enrichment of other learner corpora.

Abstract: In terms of annotation structure, most learner corpora rely on holistic flat label inventories which, even when extensive, do not explicitly separate multiple linguistic dimensions. This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender. As the first corpus designed in accordance with the recently introduced taxonomy, we expect our study to pave the way for subsequent enrichment efforts of existing error-annotated learner corpora.

### [35] [Leveraging LLMs For Turkish Skill Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22885)
*Ezgi Arslan İltüzer,Özgür Anıl Özlü,Vahid Farajijobehdar,Gülşen Eryiğit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper builds the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and shows that LLM-based pipelines outperform traditional supervised sequence labeling for extracting and linking skills from Turkish job postings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turkish is an important but underrepresented, morphologically complex language with no existing skill taxonomy or dedicated skill extraction dataset, limiting research and practical applications in recruitment, job matching, and labor market analysis. The authors aim to fill this resource gap and understand how well LLMs can handle skill extraction in a low-resource setting.

Method: The authors manually annotate a Turkish job posting dataset with labeled skill spans (4,819 spans across 327 postings) and design an end-to-end pipeline for skill extraction and linking. They compare supervised sequence labeling methods with various LLM-based approaches, experimenting with different LLMs, dynamic vs. static few-shot prompting, different context settings, and causal-reasoning-style prompts. The pipeline includes skill identification, embedding-based retrieval of candidate standardized skills from ESCO, and LLM-based reranking for final skill linking.

Result: LLM-based approaches outperform supervised sequence labeling in the end-to-end task of extracting and aligning Turkish skill mentions to standardized ESCO skills. The best configuration uses Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for span extraction, followed by embedding-based retrieval and LLM-based reranking for linking, achieving an overall end-to-end performance score of 0.56, comparable to limited existing work in other languages.

Conclusion: LLMs, when paired with appropriate prompting strategies and a retrieval-plus-reranking pipeline, significantly improve skill extraction performance for Turkish, a low-resource, morphologically rich language. The newly released dataset and results demonstrate that Turkish can reach performance levels similar to those achieved in other languages and provide a foundation and benchmark for future research on skill extraction in Turkish and other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Skill extraction is a critical component of modern recruitment systems, enabling efficient job matching, personalized recommendations, and labor market analysis. Despite Türkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.

### [36] [Should LLMs, $\textit{like}$, Generate How Users Talk? Building Dialect-Accurate Dialog[ue]s Beyond the American Default with MDial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22888)
*Jio Oh,Paul Vicinanza,Thomas Butler,Steven Euijong Whang,Dezhi Hong,Amani Namboori*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDial and MDialBench, resources and methods to generate and evaluate multi-dialectal English conversational data, revealing that LLMs perform poorly and stereotypically on non-Standard American English dialects and should not simply mimic dialect grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most English speakers use non-Standard American English dialects, yet LLMs are primarily trained and evaluated on Standard American English, leading to higher failure rates and stereotyped interactions for these users. There is a lack of systematic, large-scale tools and benchmarks to generate, control, and evaluate dialectal variation across multiple dimensions of written language, hindering fair and dialect-aware development of LLMs.

Method: The authors, in collaboration with native linguists, build MDial, a large-scale rule-based framework that transforms standard text into nine English dialects across lexical, orthographic, and morphosyntactic dimensions. The rules are annotated, scalable, and implemented via LLM-guided transformations, with careful constraints to avoid overgeneration of grammatical features. They independently evaluate the naturalness of generated dialectal text through human annotators. Using the same pipeline, they create MDialBench, a parallel multi-dialect benchmark with over 50k dialogs and 97k QA pairs, and then systematically evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks.

Result: MDial achieves high perceived naturalness in generated dialectal text, with annotators preferring its outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons. Analysis of morphosyntactic features shows that most dialect-specific grammatical features (up to 90%) should not be mirrored by LLMs for effective and appropriate communication. On MDialBench, even state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly: maximum dialect identification accuracy is below 70%, with especially low performance for Canadian English (below 50%), and systematic misclassification of non-Standard American English dialects as American or British English. These findings highlight systematic weaknesses and biases in current LLMs' dialectal competence.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current LLMs significantly underperform and exhibit biases when dealing with non-Standard American English dialects, often misidentifying them and risking cascading errors in downstream tasks. MDial and MDialBench offer scalable, high-quality tools for generating and evaluating multi-dialectal conversational data across lexical, orthographic, and grammatical dimensions. The study challenges the assumption that LLMs should emulate users' full morphosyntactic profiles, arguing instead for more nuanced dialect-aware strategies. These resources and findings provide a foundation for more equitable, dialect-robust language technologies and call for systematic inclusion of multi-dialectal evaluation in future LLM development.

Abstract: More than 80% of the 1.6 billion English speakers do not use Standard American English (SAE) and experience higher failure rates and stereotyped responses when interacting with LLMs as a result. Yet multi-dialectal performance remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{MDial}$, the first large-scale framework for generating multi-dialectal conversational data encompassing the three pillars of written dialect -- lexical (vocabulary), orthographic (spelling), and morphosyntactic (grammar) features -- for nine English dialects. Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness. Using this pipeline, we construct the dialect-parallel $\textbf{MDialBench}$mark with 50k+ dialogs, resulting in 97k+ QA pairs, and evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks. Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British. As dialect identification underpins natural language understanding, these errors risk cascading failures into downstream tasks.

### [37] [DiffuSpeech: Silent Thought, Spoken Answer via Unified Speech-Text Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22889)
*Yuxuan Lou,Ziming Wu,Yaochen Wang,Yong Liu,Yingxuan Ren,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian,Jie Tang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new diffusion-based speech-text language model, \method{}, uses internal text reasoning ("silent thought") to improve spoken answers, achieving state-of-the-art speech QA and high-quality TTS on a new 26K-sample dataset with reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech LLMs generate audio directly and autoregressively without explicit intermediate reasoning steps. Once audio is generated, errors are hard to correct, and there is no interpretable chain-of-thought to improve answer quality or guide speech generation. There is also a lack of datasets that pair speech with explicit text reasoning traces for question answering. The authors aim to introduce a paradigm where models first "think" in text while also generating speech, and to build a unified model and dataset that support this for both understanding and generation tasks.

Method: They propose \method{}, a diffusion-based speech-text language model that unifies discrete text tokens and tokenized speech within a single masked diffusion framework. The model performs iterative denoising instead of autoregressive token prediction, and uses different masking schedules for each modality so it can jointly generate internal text reasoning traces and speech tokens. They also build \dataset{}, a speech question-answering dataset with paired text reasoning traces, comprising 26K examples and 319 hours of audio. The method is evaluated on speech-to-speech QA, TTS quality, and language understanding benchmarks.

Result: \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance on speech-to-speech question answering, beating the strongest baseline by up to 9 accuracy points. It also provides the best text-to-speech quality among generative models, with a word error rate (WER) of 6.2%, and maintains strong language understanding, scoring 66.2% on MMLU. Ablation studies show that both the diffusion-based architecture and the inclusion of explicit thinking traces contribute significantly to these performance gains.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit internal text reasoning ("silent thought") into a unified diffusion-based speech-text model improves both answer correctness and speech generation quality. The proposed \method{} model and \dataset{} resource demonstrate that joint generation of reasoning traces and speech tokens is effective for speech QA, TTS, and language understanding, suggesting that future speech LLMs should incorporate intermediate reasoning steps rather than generating audio responses directly.

Abstract: Current speech language models generate responses directly without explicit reasoning, leading to errors that cannot be corrected once audio is produced. We introduce \textbf{``Silent Thought, Spoken Answer''} -- a paradigm where speech LLMs generate internal text reasoning alongside spoken responses, with thinking traces informing speech quality. To realize this, we present \method{}, the first diffusion-based speech-text language model supporting both understanding and generation, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech under a single masked diffusion framework. Unlike autoregressive approaches, \method{} jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising, with modality-specific masking schedules. We also construct \dataset{}, the first speech QA dataset with paired text reasoning traces, containing 26K samples totaling 319 hours. Experiments show \method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by up to 9 points, while attaining the best TTS quality among generative models (6.2\% WER) and preserving language understanding (66.2\% MMLU). Ablations confirm that both the diffusion architecture and thinking traces contribute to these gains.

### [38] [LLMs Explain't: A Post-Mortem on Semantic Interpretability in Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22928)
*Alhassan Abdelhalim,Janick Edinger,Sören Laue,Michaela Regneri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates common LLM interpretability methods and finds they fail to reliably reveal linguistic abstraction, arguing widely used techniques may be misleading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs and to critically assess whether popular interpretability methods truly capture what LLMs "understand," which is crucial as LLMs are widely deployed in pervasive computing.

Method: They examine two established explainability approaches: (1) probing attention heads for token-level relational structures and testing whether later-layer representations still correspond to tokens; (2) feature-mapping and property inference using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable, semantic properties, checking if predictive performance reflects real knowledge or artifacts.

Result: Both methods fail under closer scrutiny. Attention-based explanations break down when testing the assumption that later-layer representations align with tokens, and property-inference on embeddings yields apparently high predictive performance that is actually driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure, not true semantic representation.

Conclusion: Commonly used interpretability techniques for LLMs—attention analysis and embedding-based property inference—cannot currently justify claims about what LLMs understand. This undermines their use as evidence of LLM linguistic abstraction and raises concerns for their deployment in pervasive/distributed systems where interpretability guides debugging, compression, and explanation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in pervasive computing due to their versatility and strong performance. However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.
  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models.

### [39] [Relaxing Positional Alignment in Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22947)
*Mengyu Ye,Ryosuke Takahashi,Keito Kudo,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They improve masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) for open-ended generation by relaxing strict positional supervision using an alignment-flexible CTC-style objective with a <slack> token, which boosts quality and robustness to positional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion language models, while promising, underperform autoregressive models on open-ended text generation. The authors suspect this is partly because MDLMs rely on strict positional prediction, making them brittle: even a one-position token shift during decoding can severely alter semantics. This suggests a mismatch between rigid positional supervision during training and the inherently noisy, irreversible denoising process used in MDLM decoding. They seek a training strategy that better fits these dynamics and makes MDLMs more robust to positional misalignments.

Method: They analyze MDLM sensitivity to positional shifts via controlled interventions showing that a one-position shift harms semantics. To address this, they propose an alignment-flexible supervision strategy in fine-tuning, inspired by the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective. Concretely, they introduce a special <slack> token that allows flexible alignment between predicted and target token positions during training, relaxing the requirement that each target token must appear at a fixed position. This CTC-style objective is applied to an existing, widely used MDLM, without changing its basic architecture, but modifying its training loss to support soft positional alignment.

Result: On five open-ended text generation benchmarks, the MDLM fine-tuned with the proposed CTC-style, alignment-flexible supervision and <slack> token consistently outperforms the original strictly supervised model. It also exhibits greater robustness to artificial positional shifts introduced during decoding, confirming that reducing reliance on strict positional alignment improves model behavior.

Conclusion: Strict positional supervision is misaligned with the denoising dynamics of masked diffusion language models and makes them overly sensitive to token misalignment. By relaxing positional constraints using a CTC-inspired objective with a <slack> token, MDLMs generate higher-quality open-ended text and become more robust to positional shifts. Alignment-flexible training is therefore an important ingredient in closing the gap between MDLMs and autoregressive models for open-ended generation.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive approaches. Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks. Our method consistently outperforms the original model and improves robustness to positional shifts, indicating that relaxing strict positional supervision is an important factor in improving generation quality in MDLMs.

### [40] [Autonomous Chain-of-Thought Distillation for Graph-Based Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22949)
*Yuan Li,Jun Hu,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FraudCoT is a unified framework for fraud detection on text-attributed graphs that combines LLM-based chain-of-thought reasoning with GNNs via selective CoT distillation and efficient asymmetric co-training, improving both accuracy and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-enhanced GNN approaches for fraud detection on text-attributed graphs are limited by rigid, predefined prompts and separated training of LLMs and GNNs. This reduces the autonomy of reasoning and leads to weak alignment between textual semantics and graph structural information, which are both crucial for accurately detecting fraud patterns. The paper aims to overcome these issues by enabling autonomous, graph-aware reasoning and scalable joint training of LLMs and GNNs.

Method: The paper proposes FraudCoT, which operates in two main stages. First, it introduces a fraud-aware selective chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation mechanism: an LLM generates diverse, graph-aware reasoning paths for nodes, and a selective process distills the most informative CoTs. These distilled CoTs are injected back into node texts, enriching them with multi-hop semantic and structural signals. Second, the paper designs an asymmetric LLM-GNN co-training strategy that allows end-to-end optimization without the full cost of naive joint training, significantly reducing computation while maintaining effective interaction between the LLM and GNN components.

Result: On both public and industrial text-attributed graph benchmarks for fraud detection, FraudCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to an 8.8% improvement in AUPRC. Additionally, its asymmetric co-training strategy delivers dramatic efficiency gains, providing up to a 1,066x increase in training throughput compared with naive joint training baselines.

Conclusion: FraudCoT successfully enhances fraud detection on text-attributed graphs by unifying autonomous chain-of-thought reasoning from LLMs with GNN-based structural modeling. Through selective CoT distillation and efficient asymmetric co-training, it achieves better semantic-structural alignment, higher detection performance, and vastly improved training efficiency, demonstrating a practical path toward scalable LLM-GNN integration for fraud detection tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based fraud detection on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) requires jointly modeling rich textual semantics and relational dependencies. However, existing LLM-enhanced GNN approaches are constrained by predefined prompting and decoupled training pipelines, limiting reasoning autonomy and weakening semantic-structural alignment. We propose FraudCoT, a unified framework that advances TAG-based fraud detection through autonomous, graph-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and scalable LLM-GNN co-training. To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding. These distilled CoTs are integrated into node texts, providing GNNs with enriched, multi-hop semantic and structural cues for fraud detection. Furthermore, we develop an efficient asymmetric co-training strategy that enables end-to-end optimization while significantly reducing the computational cost of naive joint training. Extensive experiments on public and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FraudCoT achieves up to 8.8% AUPRC improvement over state-of-the-art methods and delivers up to 1,066x speedup in training throughput, substantially advancing both detection performance and efficiency.

### [41] [Residual Context Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22954)
*Yuezhou Hu,Harman Singh,Monishwaran Maheswaran,Haocheng Xi,Coleman Hooper,Jintao Zhang,Aditya Tomar,Michael W. Mahoney,Sewon Min,Mehrdad Farajtabar,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami,Chenfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a method to reuse discarded token computations in diffusion LLMs, improving accuracy and efficiency with small extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion LLMs decode multiple tokens in parallel but use a remasking mechanism that discards low-confidence token predictions each step, wasting the computation and contextual signal embedded in those discarded token representations.

Method: The authors propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), which converts the internal representations of discarded tokens into contextual residuals that are fed back into the model at the next denoising step. RCD is trained using a decoupled two-stage pipeline to avoid memory bottlenecks during backpropagation. It can be applied to existing dLLMs with about 1B additional training tokens, effectively augmenting the standard diffusion decoding process without major architectural changes.

Result: Across long chain-of-thought reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction-following (LLaDA) settings, RCD consistently boosts the accuracy of strong diffusion LLM baselines by 5–10 points, with minimal extra computation. On AIME-style challenging math tasks, RCD nearly doubles accuracy and achieves the same accuracy with 4–5x fewer denoising steps compared to the baseline models.

Conclusion: Recycling discarded token computations via Residual Context Diffusion is an effective way to enhance diffusion LLMs. It yields significant accuracy and efficiency gains with limited additional training, and can be retrofitted onto existing models, making dLLMs more competitive for both long and short chain-of-thought tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to purely autoregressive language models because they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a "remasking" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.

### [42] [A Unified View of Attention and Residual Sinks: Outlier-Driven Rescaling is Essential for Transformer Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22966)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies special outlier behaviors in large language models, called attention sinks and residual sinks, and proposes that they work with normalization layers to rescale other components, which aids training stability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit emergent outlier behaviors, such as certain tokens or activation dimensions having consistently large values, but the functional role of these phenomena is not well understood. Clarifying their role can improve training stability, performance, and quantization robustness.

Method: The authors empirically analyze attention sinks and residual sinks across multiple architectures and training scales, test interventions such as removing normalization, clipping outliers, absorbing them into parameters, and applying explicit gated rescaling, and then measure effects on training stability, model performance, and quantization robustness.

Result: They find that outliers appear jointly with their corresponding normalization layers, and removing normalization removes outliers but harms stability and performance. Clipping outliers while keeping normalization also degrades performance, showing outliers are functionally important. The actual direct contributions of these outliers to outputs are small, suggesting they mainly act as rescaling factors. Reparameterizing the model to absorb outliers or adding gated rescaling improves training performance by about 2 points and improves robustness under W4A4 quantization with only 1.2 points degradation.

Conclusion: Outlier tokens and activation dimensions in LLMs are not merely artifacts but play a functional role via outlier-driven rescaling together with normalization. Understanding this mechanism unifies the treatment of different sink phenomena and enables architectural or training modifications that improve performance and quantization robustness.

Abstract: We investigate the functional role of emergent outliers in large language models, specifically attention sinks (a few tokens that consistently receive large attention logits) and residual sinks (a few fixed dimensions with persistently large activations across most tokens). We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).

*Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArabicDialectHub is a cross-dialectal Arabic learning resource with 552 phrases in six Arabic varieties and an open-source interactive web platform for practice and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified, cross-dialectal learning resources for Arabic that cover multiple spoken dialects and MSA in a structured, learner-friendly way, and to provide a practical tool rather than only a static dataset.

Method: They used large language models (LLMs) to generate phrase candidates in six Arabic varieties, then had five native speakers validate and curate them. Phrases were stratified by difficulty level and organized by themes. They built an interactive web platform that supports translation exploration, adaptive quizzing with algorithmically generated distractors, cloud-synced user progress, and presentation of cultural notes. Both the dataset and platform were released as open source under the MIT license.

Result: The outcome is (1) a validated dataset of 552 phrases aligned across Moroccan Darija, Lebanese, Syrian, Emirati, Saudi, and Modern Standard Arabic; and (2) a fully functional, publicly accessible web platform implementing learning features like adaptive quizzes, automatic distractor generation, progress tracking, and cultural context display.

Conclusion: ArabicDialectHub offers a practical, open, and extensible resource for learners and researchers interested in multiple Arabic dialects. By combining LLM-generated, human-validated content with an interactive platform, it lowers the barrier to comparative dialect learning and can serve as a foundation for future educational and NLP work on Arabic varieties.

Abstract: We present ArabicDialectHub, a cross-dialectal Arabic learning resource comprising 552 phrases across six varieties (Moroccan Darija, Lebanese, Syrian, Emirati, Saudi, and MSA) and an interactive web platform. Phrases were generated using LLMs and validated by five native speakers, stratified by difficulty, and organized thematically. The open-source platform provides translation exploration, adaptive quizzing with algorithmic distractor generation, cloud-synchronized progress tracking, and cultural context.

### [44] [Bias Beyond Borders: Political Ideology Evaluation and Steering in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23001)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Agrima,Mehwish Nasim,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes and evaluates a method to reduce and harmonize political bias in multilingual LLMs across many countries and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs influence public discourse worldwide, so their political bias and lack of neutrality can have widespread impact. Existing work mostly targets Western, high-resource languages and does not sufficiently address how biases behave and can be mitigated consistently across many languages. There is a need for scalable, safe, and cross-lingually consistent mitigation methods.

Method: The authors conduct a large-scale evaluation of political bias in LLMs across 50 countries and 33 languages. They introduce Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), a post-hoc steering framework that: (1) induces latent ideological representations with political prompts in different languages, (2) aligns these representations into a shared ideological subspace across languages, and (3) adaptively regulates the strength of steering to avoid over-correction while maintaining response coherence. CLAS is designed to complement existing steering techniques rather than replace them.

Result: Using CLAS leads to substantial reductions in measured political bias along both economic and social dimensions across the evaluated languages and countries. This mitigation is achieved with minimal loss in overall response quality, indicating that the method can correct ideological skew without significantly degrading the usefulness or fluency of model outputs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CLAS offers a scalable, interpretable, and effective approach for fairness-aware governance of multilingual LLMs. By aligning ideological representations across languages and adaptively controlling intervention, it helps achieve more neutral and consistent behavior while still respecting linguistic and cultural diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape global discourse, making fairness and ideological neutrality essential for responsible AI deployment. Despite growing attention to political bias in LLMs, prior work largely focuses on high-resource, Western languages or narrow multilingual settings, leaving cross-lingual consistency and safe post-hoc mitigation underexplored. To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence. Experiments demonstrate substantial bias reduction along both economic and social axes with minimal degradation in response quality. The proposed framework establishes a scalable and interpretable paradigm for fairness-aware multilingual LLM governance, balancing ideological neutrality with linguistic and cultural diversity.

### [45] [InstructDiff: Domain-Adaptive Data Selection via Differential Entropy for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23006)
*Junyou Su,He Zhu,Xiao Luo,Liyu Zhang,Hong-Yu Zhou,Yun Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce InstructDiff, an entropy-difference-based data selection method for supervised fine-tuning that beats full-data training using only 10% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT on full datasets is costly and yields diminishing returns, and existing data selection methods are highly domain-specific and do not generalize across reasoning vs. general instruction tasks.

Method: Measure entropy differences between a base LLM and a minimally instruction-tuned calibrated model, then apply a unified, domain-adaptive framework (warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, entropy-based ranking) to select low differential-entropy samples, with domain-dependent interpretation (entropy increase for reasoning, decrease for general tasks).

Result: InstructDiff, when used to select 10% of training data, achieves up to 17% relative improvement over full-data training on math reasoning and 52% relative improvement on general instruction-following, surpassing previous data selection baselines.

Conclusion: Differential entropy between base and calibrated models is a powerful, domain-adaptive signal for data selection in SFT, enabling more efficient and more effective fine-tuning across both reasoning and general instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to adapting large language models, yet training on complete datasets incurs prohibitive costs with diminishing returns. Existing data selection methods suffer from severe domain specificity: techniques optimized for general instruction-following fail on reasoning tasks, and vice versa. We observe that measuring entropy differences between base models and minimally instruction-tuned calibrated models reveals a pattern -- samples with the lowest differential entropy consistently yield optimal performance across domains, yet this principle manifests domain-adaptively: reasoning tasks favor entropy increase (cognitive expansion), while general tasks favor entropy decrease (cognitive compression). We introduce InstructDiff, a unified framework that operationalizes differential entropy as a domain-adaptive selection criterion through warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking. Extensive experiments show that InstructDiff achieves 17\% relative improvement over full data training on mathematical reasoning and 52\% for general instruction-following, outperforming prior baselines while using only 10\% of the data.

### [46] [DimABSA: Building Multilingual and Multidomain Datasets for Dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23022)
*Lung-Hao Lee,Liang-Chih Yu,Natalia Loukashevich,Ilseyar Alimova,Alexander Panchenko,Tzu-Mi Lin,Zhe-Yu Xu,Jian-Yu Zhou,Guangmin Zheng,Jin Wang,Sharanya Awasthi,Jonas Becker,Jan Philip Wahle,Terry Ruas,Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad,Saif M. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They create DimABSA, a large multilingual dataset and benchmark for aspect-based sentiment analysis with continuous valence-arousal scores instead of just discrete labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aspect-based sentiment analysis mostly uses coarse sentiment categories like positive/negative, which cannot represent nuanced emotional states and ignores dimensional emotion theories (valence, arousal). There is also a lack of multilingual resources that align traditional ABSA annotations with continuous emotion dimensions.

Method: They design DimABSA, a multilingual corpus annotated with standard ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, opinion terms) plus continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores for each aspect instance. The dataset spans six languages, four domains, and nearly 77k aspect instances. They define three subtasks that mix VA prediction with different ABSA structures, and introduce a unified evaluation metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which augments standard F1 with an error term for VA regression. They benchmark both prompted and fine-tuned large language models on these subtasks.

Result: DimABSA comprises 76,958 aspect instances from 42,590 sentences across six languages and four domains, each annotated with ABSA structures and VA scores. Experiments with both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across the three subtasks show relatively low performance, indicating the tasks are challenging. The cF1 metric works as a unified way to assess performance on the mixed categorical-continuous outputs.

Conclusion: The new DimABSA resource enables fine-grained, multidimensional sentiment analysis at the aspect level across multiple languages, and the proposed subtasks plus cF1 metric form a challenging benchmark. This work lays the groundwork for transitioning from traditional categorical ABSA towards richer, dimensional sentiment modeling and encourages further method development in this direction.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) focuses on extracting sentiment at a fine-grained aspect level and has been widely applied across real-world domains. However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks. Our results show that DimABSA is a challenging benchmark and provides a foundation for advancing multilingual dimensional ABSA.

### [47] [Character as a Latent Variable in Large Language Models: A Mechanistic Account of Emergent Misalignment and Conditional Safety Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23081)
*Yanghao Su,Wenbo Zhou,Tianwei Zhang,Qiu Han,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies “emergent misalignment” in LLMs and finds that fine-tuning on data with certain character-like dispositions (not just wrong answers) causes broad, transferable misaligned behavior without significantly harming capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanations say emergent misalignment comes from models generalizing from bad or unsafe content. The authors argue this is incomplete and want to understand whether deeper, persona-like behavioral shifts are actually responsible, which matters for how we design alignment strategies and fine-tuning pipelines.

Method: They fine-tune multiple LLM families in multiple domains on different types of data: (1) data that encodes particular character-level dispositions or personas and (2) data that gives incorrect or unsafe advice. They then measure how much misalignment emerges, how transferable it is across tasks and prompts, how capabilities are affected, and whether the misaligned behavior can be triggered by training-time triggers or by persona-style prompts at inference time. They also compare this with behaviors seen in backdoor and jailbreak settings.

Result: Fine-tuning on character-level dispositions produces much stronger and more widely transferable misalignment than simply fine-tuning on incorrect advice, while leaving general capabilities mostly intact. The misalignment behaves like a stable change in the model’s “character” rather than a loss of knowledge. These dispositions can be turned on conditionally via specific triggers in training or through persona-aligned prompts at inference, paralleling known backdoor and jailbreak behaviors.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment is better understood as a shift in the model’s underlying behavioral disposition or “character,” not merely as generalized errors or corrupted knowledge. Because these persona-like dispositions can be triggered and are structurally similar to backdoors and jailbreaks, alignment approaches must focus on identifying and constraining these deeper behavioral patterns instead of relying only on error correction or superficial prompt-level safeguards.

Abstract: Emergent Misalignment refers to a failure mode in which fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on narrowly scoped data induces broadly misaligned behavior. Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.

### [48] [Safer Policy Compliance with Dynamic Epistemic Fallback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23094)
*Joseph Marvin Imperial,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a cognitively inspired, inference-time safety protocol that helps LLMs detect and resist deceptive attacks based on perturbed legal policy texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like legal compliance, where malicious actors might subtly perturb policy texts (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) to deceive models into giving harmful or non-compliant outputs. Humans employ epistemic vigilance to detect deception; the authors aim to design an analogous mechanism for LLMs to improve robustness against such attacks without retraining models.

Method: The authors design Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a protocol that uses short, one-sentence prompts at inference time to nudge LLMs to: (1) actively check for inconsistencies or suspicious content in provided legal policy texts, (2) flag or refuse to comply when text appears perturbed or malicious, and (3) fall back to the model's internal/parametric knowledge of the underlying policies instead of trusting the input text. They test several levels/styles of these textual cues with multiple frontier LLMs on tasks involving original vs. adversarially perturbed versions of HIPAA and GDPR provisions, measuring detection and refusal behavior.

Result: Across multiple LLMs and experimental settings, DEF significantly increases detection and refusal of adversarially perturbed legal policy texts compared to baseline prompting without DEF. In some configurations, such as with the DeepSeek-R1 model under a particular DEF cue design, the detection rate of perturbed policies reaches 100%. This shows that simple, cognitively motivated prompt-level interventions can substantially boost robustness against deceptive legal-text attacks.

Conclusion: Dynamic Epistemic Fallback is an effective, lightweight, inference-time defense that improves LLM robustness to deceptive, perturbed legal policies by leveraging cognitively inspired cues analogous to human epistemic vigilance. The results suggest that cognitively informed prompt protocols can meaningfully enhance safety in high-stakes applications like automated legal compliance, and the authors call for further work on such cognitively grounded defenses against harm and deception exploiting legal artifacts.

Abstract: Humans develop a series of cognitive defenses, known as epistemic vigilance, to combat risks of deception and misinformation from everyday interactions. Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting. This work encourages further efforts to develop cognitively inspired defenses to improve LLM robustness against forms of harm and deception that exploit legal artifacts.

### [49] [Evaluating the Utility of Grounding Documents with Reference-Free LLM-based Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23129)
*Yilun Hua,Giuseppe Castellucci,Peter Schulam,Heba Elfardy,Kevin Small*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GroGU, a model-specific, reference-free metric that measures how useful retrieved grounding documents are to a downstream LLM by looking at changes in its generation confidence (entropy), and uses it to improve RAG query rewriting and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems rely heavily on the quality and usefulness (utility) of retrieved grounding content, but there is no clear, standardized way to quantify this utility. Existing metrics are either LLM-agnostic, ignore the specific capabilities and behavior of the target model, or depend on expensive human or model-based annotations. The authors want an automatic, model-aware way to measure how much a given document actually helps the LLM generate better answers, so they can better select, evaluate, and train components like retrievers and query rewriters.

Method: They propose Grounding Generation Utility (GroGU), a metric that: (1) treats the downstream LLM as the object whose utility we care about; (2) defines utility in terms of the model’s generation confidence, operationalized via output entropy; and (3) does not require external references or annotations. Concretely, they compare the LLM’s entropy (or change in entropy) when generating answers with and without particular grounding documents, or across different candidate grounding sets, and use this to score each document or set. These scores then serve as a signal for preference data selection: they identify high-utility examples and feed them into Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train a query rewriter tailored for RAG.

Result: Empirically, GroGU can reliably distinguish true relevant documents from distractors and captures fine-grained utility differences that LLM-agnostic metrics miss, even though it does not use annotations. When used to curate high-utility preference pairs for DPO-based training of a query rewriter in RAG pipelines, systems trained with GroGU-selected data show substantial gains: up to +18.2 points in Mean Reciprocal Rank for retrieval quality and up to +9.4 points in answer accuracy in downstream evaluation.

Conclusion: GroGU offers a practical, reference-free, and model-specific way to measure grounding utility in RAG, aligning evaluation with the actual behavior and confidence of the target LLM. It can replace or complement annotation-heavy or LLM-agnostic metrics and is useful as a training signal—for example, to improve query rewriting—leading to sizable performance improvements in both retrieval and answer quality.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)'s success depends on the utility the LLM derives from the content used for grounding. Quantifying content utility does not have a definitive specification and existing metrics ignore model-specific capabilities and/or rely on costly annotations. In this paper, we propose Grounding Generation Utility (GroGU), a model-specific and reference-free metric that defines utility as a function of the downstream LLM's generation confidence based on entropy. Despite having no annotation requirements, GroGU is largely faithful in distinguishing ground-truth documents while capturing nuances ignored by LLM-agnostic metrics. We apply GroGU to train a query-rewriter for RAG by identifying high-utility preference data for Direct Preference Optimization. Experiments show improvements by up to 18.2 points in Mean Reciprocal Rank and up to 9.4 points in answer accuracy.

### [50] [Monotonic Reference-Free Refinement for Autoformalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23166)
*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose a reference-free, iterative method to automatically formalize full theorems, jointly improving several quality dimensions using feedback from theorem provers and LLM judges, and show strong results on miniF2F and ProofNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoformalization methods mainly handle statements and focus on isolated aspects like syntax, failing to jointly optimize multiple dimensions required for full-theorem autoformalization. There is a need for a method that can iteratively improve formalizations across several quality axes without relying on ground-truth proofs or prior formalizations.

Method: They design a reference-free iterative refinement process for full-theorem autoformalization. It uses complementary feedback from automated theorem provers and large language models acting as judges, optimizing a masked composite objective capturing Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality. A responsiveness map is used to understand which LLM roles better improve which dimensions. They also define an acceptance policy that guarantees monotonic improvement and provide theoretical conditions for convergence and termination.

Result: Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet show the method can simultaneously improve multiple formalization quality dimensions, achieving 93.44% formal validity and a 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and a 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.

Conclusion: A reference-free, multi-objective iterative process guided by theorem provers and LLM judges can effectively autoformalize full theorems, providing certified monotonic improvements and strong empirical performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: While statement autoformalization has advanced rapidly, full-theorem autoformalization remains largely unexplored. Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination. Empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed process enables simultaneous improvement across multiple dimensions, achieving 93.44% formal validity and a 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and a 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.

### [51] [FourierSampler: Unlocking Non-Autoregressive Potential in Diffusion Language Models via Frequency-Guided Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23182)
*Siyang He,Qiqi Wang,Xiaoran Liu,Hongnan Ma,Yiwei Shi,Yuerong Song,Ying Zhu,Tianyi Liang,Zengfeng Huang,Ziwei He,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They analyze diffusion language models in the frequency domain and design a Fourier-based decoding method (FourierSampler) that first generates global structure (low frequencies) then local details (high frequencies), significantly improving non-autoregressive generation quality over prior methods and even similar-size autoregressive LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models can, in principle, generate tokens in arbitrary order and avoid the limitations of left-to-right autoregressive decoding, but current decoding strategies show strong positional bias and do not exploit this flexibility well. The authors want to understand what different frequency components in dLLM hidden states represent, and then use this understanding to design a better, less position-biased sampling/inference method.

Method: They perform a frequency-domain (Fourier) analysis of hidden states in diffusion language models, decomposing them into low- and high-frequency components and studying what information each band carries. They find that low frequencies encode global structure and long-range dependencies, while high frequencies encode local details. Leveraging this, they propose FourierSampler, a decoding algorithm that applies a sliding window in the frequency domain to steer generation from coarse global structure to fine details, effectively providing a structure-to-detail decoding schedule for non-autoregressive text generation.

Result: Empirically, FourierSampler improves decoding quality on benchmarks like LLADA and SDAR. It achieves relative performance gains of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct compared with other inference enhancement strategies for diffusion LLMs. It also outperforms similarly sized autoregressive baselines, including Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, showing that improved decoding can unlock more of the intrinsic modeling capacity of diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain analysis reveals a clear division of labor in dLLM hidden-state spectra: low frequencies capture global, long-range structure and high frequencies capture local details. Exploiting this with the FourierSampler decoding strategy yields a structure-first, detail-later generation process that substantially boosts diffusion LLM performance and can even surpass comparable autoregressive LLMs, suggesting that better inference, not just better models, is key to realizing the full promise of diffusion-based language modeling.

Abstract: Despite the non-autoregressive potential of diffusion language models (dLLMs), existing decoding strategies demonstrate positional bias, failing to fully unlock the potential of arbitrary generation. In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a "structure-to-detail" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It notably surpasses similarly sized autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct.

### [52] [JobResQA: A Benchmark for LLM Machine Reading Comprehension on Multilingual Résumés and JDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23183)
*Casimiro Pio Carrino,Paula Estrella,Rabih Zbib,Carlos Escolano,José A. R. Fonollosa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JobResQA is a multilingual benchmark to test how well LLMs answer HR-related questions about résumés and job descriptions across five languages and varying reasoning complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in HR tasks like screening résumés and matching them with job descriptions, but there is a lack of realistic, multilingual, and privacy-preserving benchmarks to evaluate their machine reading comprehension, especially for fairness and bias across demographic and professional attributes. Existing datasets often focus on English, simple fact extraction, or non-HR domains, making it hard to assess real-world HR use cases and multilingual performance gaps.

Method: The authors create JobResQA, a benchmark of 581 QA pairs built on 105 synthetic résumé–job description pairs in five languages (EN, ES, IT, DE, ZH). They design a data generation pipeline that starts from real-world HR data, then applies de-identification and data synthesis to preserve realism while protecting privacy. Controlled demographic and professional features are encoded using placeholders so that bias and fairness can be studied systematically. For multilinguality, they use a TEaR-based human-in-the-loop translation process: initial machine translation, MQM-style error annotation, and selective human post-editing to obtain a high-quality multi-way parallel corpus. They then run baseline evaluations on several open-weight LLMs using an LLM-as-judge scoring framework.

Result: The resulting JobResQA benchmark covers three levels of QA difficulty, from simple factual queries to complex cross-document reasoning over résumés and job descriptions, and is available in five aligned languages. Baseline experiments show that current open-weight LLMs perform relatively well on English and Spanish but experience notable performance drops for Italian, German, and Chinese. This demonstrates that multilingual HR-focused MRC remains uneven and that non-English languages are particularly underserved.

Conclusion: JobResQA is a reproducible, publicly available benchmark for evaluating and comparing LLMs on realistic, HR-specific machine reading comprehension tasks over résumés and job descriptions in multiple languages. Its design supports investigations into model fairness and bias via controlled attributes, while the multilingual and multi-level structure exposes important weaknesses in current LLMs, especially for less well-supported languages. The authors position JobResQA as a tool to guide the development of fairer, more robust, and more reliable LLM-based HR systems.

Abstract: We introduce JobResQA, a multilingual Question Answering benchmark for evaluating Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) capabilities of LLMs on HR-specific tasks involving résumés and job descriptions. The dataset comprises 581 QA pairs across 105 synthetic résumé-job description pairs in five languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese), with questions spanning three complexity levels from basic factual extraction to complex cross-document reasoning. We propose a data generation pipeline derived from real-world sources through de-identification and data synthesis to ensure both realism and privacy, while controlled demographic and professional attributes (implemented via placeholders) enable systematic bias and fairness studies. We also present a cost-effective, human-in-the-loop translation pipeline based on the TEaR methodology, incorporating MQM error annotations and selective post-editing to ensure an high-quality multi-way parallel benchmark. We provide a baseline evaluations across multiple open-weight LLM families using an LLM-as-judge approach revealing higher performances on English and Spanish but substantial degradation for other languages, highlighting critical gaps in multilingual MRC capabilities for HR applications. JobResQA provides a reproducible benchmark for advancing fair and reliable LLM-based HR systems. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://github.com/Avature/jobresqa-benchmark

### [53] [ReGuLaR: Variational Latent Reasoning Guided by Rendered Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23184)
*Fanmeng Wang,Haotian Liu,Guojiang Zhao,Hongteng Xu,Zhifeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose ReGuLaR, a VAE-based latent reasoning method that uses images of Chain-of-Thought traces to guide compression, achieving faster yet accurate reasoning that can even beat standard CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought improves LLM reasoning but is computationally expensive because explicit reasoning chains are long. Latent reasoning tries to make it cheaper by compressing reasoning steps into a hidden space, but existing approaches lose much performance due to unguided or poorly guided compression. The authors want a way to keep most of CoT’s benefits while greatly reducing computation, by providing a better training signal for how to compress reasoning traces into latents.

Method: They define latent reasoning as a sequential Variational Autoencoder: each latent state is sampled from a posterior conditioned on previous latent states. During training, instead of just compressing text, they first render explicit CoT reasoning chains as images. From these images they extract dense visual-semantic representations (features) and use them to regularize the posterior distribution over latents, guiding it to retain the essential structure and content of the reasoning. This is a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm that ties multimodal visual features of rendered reasoning to the internal latent reasoning space, promoting efficient but faithful compression of CoT.

Result: Across benchmarks, ReGuLaR outperforms existing latent reasoning methods on both compute efficiency and reasoning accuracy. It also surpasses standard explicit CoT itself when leveraging its multimodal reasoning setup, indicating that the guided latent space not only preserves performance but can improve it.

Conclusion: Guiding a variational latent reasoning model with visual-semantic features extracted from rendered CoT chains enables effective compression of reasoning with minimal information loss. This ReGuLaR paradigm makes reasoning more computationally efficient than explicit CoT, improves over prior latent reasoning techniques, and can even outperform CoT through multimodal reasoning, offering a promising new direction for efficient LLM reasoning systems.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), explicit reasoning chains introduce substantial computational redundancy. Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

### [54] [Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23188)
*Zhongxiang Sun,Qipeng Wang,Weijie Yu,Jingxuan Yang,Haolang Lu,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS-MCM, a deep search framework for LLM-based agents that augments standard deep search with hierarchical metacognitive monitoring to improve robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLM-based deep search agents show strong multi-step reasoning and retrieval abilities, they frequently fail in practice because they lack mechanisms to continuously monitor and regulate their reasoning and retrieval states as tasks progress under uncertainty. Inspired by hierarchical human metacognition—combining fast anomaly detection and slower, experience-driven reflection—the authors aim to build similar monitoring into deep search agents.

Method: The authors propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), which embeds a hierarchical monitoring system into the reasoning–retrieval loop of LLM agents. DS-MCM consists of: (1) a Fast Consistency Monitor that performs lightweight checks to compare external evidence against the agent’s internal reasoning confidence, and (2) a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor that is selectively triggered when needed and uses stored experience memories from past agent trajectories to plan corrective interventions. The framework decides both when to intervene and how to adjust the search based on prior experience, integrating these monitors directly into multi-step search and retrieval.

Result: Across various deep search benchmarks and with different backbone language models, DS-MCM yields consistent gains in performance and robustness compared to baseline deep search agents without such metacognitive monitoring. The experiments show that adding the hierarchical monitors helps detect and correct reasoning or retrieval failures during task execution.

Conclusion: Embedding hierarchical metacognitive monitoring—via fast consistency checks and selective, experience-based reflection—into deep search agents significantly enhances their ability to handle long-horizon, uncertain tasks. DS-MCM offers a general framework for making LLM-based search agents more reliable and robust by learning when and how to intervene in their ongoing reasoning and retrieval processes.

Abstract: Deep search agents powered by large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in multi-step retrieval, reasoning, and long-horizon task execution. However, their practical failures often stem from the lack of mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval states as tasks evolve under uncertainty. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness.

### [55] [Are you going to finish that? A Practical Study of the Tokenization Boundary Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23223)
*Hao Xu,Alisa Liu,Jonathan Hayase,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies the “partial token problem,” where user prompts end mid-token, showing that this significantly distorts language model next-token probabilities even for natural, word-complete text in certain languages and code, and evaluates mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models operate on subword tokens, but humans write in text with words and characters. When a prompt ends partway through a token, the model’s conditional distribution can be badly distorted. Prior work mostly used artificial character prefixes and did not quantify how often and how severely this happens in realistic settings, especially for languages and domains where token and word boundaries frequently mismatch. The paper aims to measure the prevalence, severity, and scaling behavior of this problem, and to assess practical fixes for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors first identify domains with frequent misalignment between word and token boundaries: non-whitespace languages (e.g., Chinese), highly compounding languages, and code. They quantify how often natural word boundaries do not align with token boundaries (e.g., ~25% in Chinese). They then systematically construct semantically natural prompts that end with partial tokens and run controlled experiments comparing next-token probabilities for these prompts versus “backed-off” prompts that are forced to end at token boundaries. They evaluate multiple frontier LMs across scales and test various inference-time mitigation strategies, including recently proposed exact solutions, measuring the change in probability assigned to correct continuations.

Result: They show that natural prompts that end on partial tokens constitute a substantial failure mode: frontier LMs assign roughly three orders of magnitude less probability to the correct continuation compared with token-aligned prompts. This probability distortion is robust across domains (Chinese, other highly compounding languages, and code) and does not improve with larger models; in fact, it often becomes worse as model size increases. The experiments also demonstrate that certain inference-time mitigation techniques, especially recent exact methods, can largely correct this distortion.

Conclusion: The partial token problem is common in realistic use of language models for certain languages and code, and it severely distorts next-token probabilities even for semantically natural prompts. Model scaling alone does not resolve the issue and may exacerbate it. However, carefully designed inference-time mitigation strategies can effectively address the problem. The authors conclude that tokenization-induced probability distortion is a serious, underappreciated issue and offer practical recommendations for inference providers to adopt mitigation methods in production systems.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and "word" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is "backed-off" to be token-aligned. This degradation does not diminish with scale and often worsens for larger models. Finally, we evaluate inference-time mitigations to the partial token problem and validate the effectiveness of recent exact solutions. Overall, we demonstrate the scale and severity of probability distortion caused by tokenization in realistic use cases, and provide practical recommentions for model inference providers.

### [56] [Now You Hear Me: Audio Narrative Attacks Against Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23255)
*Ye Yu,Haibo Jin,Yaoning Yu,Jun Zhuang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper shows that audio-based jailbreaks using narrative synthetic speech can bypass safety in large audio-language models with very high success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models move from text-only to speech-based interfaces, new, poorly understood security vulnerabilities may emerge, especially because existing safeguards are tuned to textual inputs.

Method: Design a text-to-audio jailbreak by using an advanced instruction-following TTS system to embed disallowed instructions inside a longer narrative-style audio, exploiting both structural (story context, ordering) and acoustic properties of speech, and test it against state-of-the-art audio-language models.

Result: The narrative synthetic speech jailbreak triggers restricted outputs from leading models such as Gemini 2.0 Flash with a 98.26% success rate, significantly outperforming equivalent jailbreaks presented purely as text.

Conclusion: Current safety mechanisms for audio-language models are inadequate because they focus mainly on text; robust safety will require defenses that integrate linguistic content with paralinguistic audio cues, especially as speech-based interfaces become widespread.

Abstract: Large audio-language models increasingly operate on raw speech inputs, enabling more seamless integration across domains such as voice assistants, education, and clinical triage. This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent.

### [57] [PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23265)
*Dawei Zhu,Rui Meng,Yale Song,Xiyu Wei,Sujian Li,Tomas Pfister,Jinsung Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaperBanana is an agent-based system that automatically generates publication-ready academic illustrations using VLMs and image generation models, outperforming baselines on a new NeurIPS-based benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality, publication-ready figures and methodology diagrams is still time-consuming and labor-intensive for researchers, even as autonomous AI systems for text and code have advanced rapidly. There is a lack of automated, reliable tools tailored for academic illustration generation and an absence of a standardized benchmark to evaluate such systems.

Method: The authors propose PaperBanana, an agentic framework that coordinates multiple specialized agents powered by state-of-the-art vision-language models and image generators. These agents retrieve reference materials, plan the figure’s content and style, render candidate images, and iteratively refine them using self-critique loops. To evaluate the framework, they build PaperBananaBench, a benchmark of 292 methodology-diagram test cases taken from NeurIPS 2025 papers, encompassing varied domains and illustration styles.

Result: Experiments on PaperBananaBench show that PaperBanana systematically surpasses leading baseline systems on multiple qualitative dimensions, including faithfulness to the described method, conciseness of the visual representation, readability of the figure, and overall aesthetics. The framework also generalizes well to creating statistical plots, producing high-quality visualizations beyond methodology diagrams.

Conclusion: PaperBanana demonstrates that multi-agent, VLM-driven pipelines can reliably generate publication-ready academic illustrations and statistical plots, substantially reducing the manual effort required from researchers. By releasing both the framework and the PaperBananaBench benchmark, the work lays a foundation for future research on automated scientific figure generation and more capable AI-assisted research workflows.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in autonomous AI scientists powered by language models, generating publication-ready illustrations remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in the research workflow. To lift this burden, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework for automated generation of publication-ready academic illustrations. Powered by state-of-the-art VLMs and image generation models, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents to retrieve references, plan content and style, render images, and iteratively refine via self-critique. To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising 292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics. We further show that our method effectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots. Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations.

### [58] [JAF: Judge Agent Forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22269)
*Sahil Garg,Brad Cheezum,Sridhar Dutta,Vishal Agarwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Judge Agent Forest (JAF), a framework where a judge agent evaluates multiple related query–response pairs jointly instead of in isolation, enabling better self-refinement of an AI agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing judge agents in agentic AI usually evaluate each query–response pair independently, missing cross-instance patterns, inconsistencies, and higher-level structure. There is also a limitation in how exemplar contexts are selected, often relying only on kNN in embedding space and ignoring categorical/domain structure and side information.

Method: The authors propose JAF, where a judge agent performs joint inference over a cohort of query–response pairs, using overlapping in-context neighborhoods to form a knowledge-graph-like structure. They implement JAF via in-context learning (ICL), prompting the judge with the primary agent’s response plus a small set of peer exemplars. To select exemplars, they design a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns binary hash codes by combining semantic embeddings, LLM-generated hash predicates, supervision from labels, and side information. These codes enable efficient, interpretable, relation-aware exemplar selection and improved exploration of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths.

Result: They empirically evaluate JAF on the challenging real-world task of cloud misconfiguration triage in large-scale cloud environments, demonstrating that JAF’s joint judging and advanced exemplar selection are effective (details like metrics are not given in the abstract but implied to be positive).

Conclusion: Joint evaluation across related instances and learned, relation-aware exemplar selection significantly improve judge-agent quality and thus the primary agent’s reasoning. JAF conceptually connects belief propagation and ensemble learning, and can be realized fully through in-context learning, making it a practical and powerful approach for complex tasks such as cloud misconfiguration triage.

Abstract: Judge agents are fundamental to agentic AI frameworks: they provide automated evaluation, and enable iterative self-refinement of reasoning processes. We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.
  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.
  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.

### [59] [The Six Sigma Agent: Achieving Enterprise-Grade Reliability in LLM Systems Through Consensus-Driven Decomposed Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22290)
*Khush Patel,Siva Surendira,Jithin George,Shreyas Kapale*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose a Six Sigma Agent architecture that boosts LLM reliability via task decomposition, parallel micro-agents, and consensus voting to reach enterprise-grade, Six Sigma-level error rates using even cheaper models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but inherently probabilistic and error-prone, which is unacceptable for many enterprise applications needing very high reliability. Existing approaches focus on scaling models rather than designing system-level architectures that provide guarantees similar to Six Sigma standards in industrial quality control.

Method: They design an architecture with three key components: (1) decompose complex tasks into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) execute each atomic action multiple times in parallel using diverse LLMs (micro-agents) to get independent samples; (3) apply consensus voting with dynamic scaling by clustering outputs and choosing the majority cluster, increasing the number of agents as needed. They provide a theoretical analysis showing how majority voting over n independent agents with individual error rate p gives a system error on the order of p^{ceil(n/2)}.

Result: Theoretical results show exponential reduction in system error as the number of sampled agents increases. For example, with individual action error of 5%, using 5 agents in consensus drops error to ~0.11%, and dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves about 3.4 defects per million opportunities (Six Sigma). Empirically, on three enterprise use cases, the architecture yields around 14,700x reliability improvement over a single-agent baseline, while also reducing operational costs by ~80%, partly through the use of cheaper base models and efficient scaling.

Conclusion: System-level reliability for AI can be dramatically improved by orchestrating multiple imperfect LLMs with redundancy and consensus mechanisms, rather than only by scaling individual models. Their Six Sigma Agent provides a practical, theoretically grounded path to enterprise-grade reliability using task decomposition, parallelization, and majority voting, achieving Six Sigma-level performance at lower cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities yet remain fundamentally probabilistic, presenting critical reliability challenges for enterprise deployment. We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.

### [60] [Why Reasoning Fails to Plan: A Planning-Centric Analysis of Long-Horizon Decision Making in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22311)
*Zehong Wang,Fang Wu,Hongru Wang,Xiangru Tang,Bolian Li,Zhenfei Yin,Yijun Ma,Yiyang Li,Weixiang Sun,Xiusi Chen,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a key weakness of current LLM agents in long-horizon tasks and proposes FLARE, a planning-oriented framework that adds future-aware lookahead and value estimation, significantly improving long-horizon performance and clarifying the difference between reasoning and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents are good at short, step-by-step reasoning but often fail on tasks requiring long-horizon planning, where early decisions affect much later outcomes. Existing step-wise reasoning effectively behaves like a greedy policy that doesn’t properly account for delayed consequences, leading to systematic failures in structured environments that demand coherent plans over many steps.

Method: The authors adopt a planning-centric view and analyze LLM agents in deterministic environments with explicit states, transitions, and rewards. They show that step-wise scoring creates locally optimal but myopic decisions that lock the agent into poor trajectories. To address this, they propose FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation), a mechanism integrated into a single LLM that performs explicit lookahead over future states, propagates estimated values back to earlier decisions, and limits early commitment so that later information can revise choices.

Result: On multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and with different LLM backbones, FLARE robustly improves both task success rates and qualitative planning behavior. Notably, LLaMA-8B equipped with FLARE often surpasses GPT-4o that relies only on standard step-by-step reasoning, demonstrating that adding planning structure can compensate for weaker base models and highlighting the performance gap between reasoning-only and planning-aware agents.

Conclusion: The work shows that reasoning-by-itself, implemented as step-by-step chain-of-thought, is not sufficient for long-horizon decision-making because it induces a greedy, myopic policy. By incorporating future-aware planning through FLARE’s lookahead and value propagation, LLM agents can better align early actions with long-term outcomes. This establishes a clear conceptual and empirical separation between reasoning and planning and suggests that effective LLM agents must explicitly integrate planning mechanisms rather than relying solely on local reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents exhibit strong step-by-step reasoning capabilities over short horizons, yet often fail to sustain coherent behavior over long planning horizons. We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning.

### [61] [Sparks of Rationality: Do Reasoning LLMs Align with Human Judgment and Choice?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22329)
*Ala N. Tak,Amin Banayeeanzade,Anahita Bolourani,Fatemeh Bahrani,Ashutosh Chaubey,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy,Norbert Schwarz,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether large language models show human-like rationality and emotional biases in decision-making, and how 'thinking harder' and emotional steering methods affect their choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are being used for high-stakes decisions in areas like hiring and healthcare, where human judgment usually combines rational analysis with emotional biases. To use LLMs safely and as models of human behavior, we need to understand if they follow principles of rational choice, how they deviate in human-like ways, and how emotion-like signals interact with their reasoning.

Method: The authors test several LLM families on two kinds of tasks: (1) benchmarks for core axioms of rational choice (e.g., consistency, expected-value maximization), and (2) classic behavioral-economics and social-norm scenarios where emotions shape decisions. They compare shallow vs. more deliberate reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought) and apply two emotion-steering interventions: in-context priming (ICP), which sets an emotional frame via prompt examples, and representation-level steering (RLS), which manipulates internal representations to encode affective states. They then measure how these factors change rationality and bias patterns.

Result: More deliberate reasoning consistently increases rationality and moves models toward expected-value maximizing choices. Emotion steering via ICP can create strong, directional, but often overly extreme and hard-to-control shifts in decisions. RLS produces more moderate, psychologically realistic affective biases but with less consistent effects. The same mechanisms that support improved rationality also make models more sensitive to emotional interventions, and different steering methods show a trade-off between degree of control and similarity to human behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs can be made more rational by encouraging deliberation, but this also increases their susceptibility to affective steering. Emotional interventions can push decisions in human-like ways, but current methods either lack fine control (ICP) or reliability (RLS). There is an inherent tension between enhancing reasoning and safely steering affective responses, raising important concerns for using LLMs as human simulators or decision engines in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as decision engines for hiring, healthcare, and economic judgment, yet real-world human judgment reflects a balance between rational deliberation and emotion-driven bias. If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate "thinking" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.

Le,Thang Luong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Case study using Gemini to help solve and reclassify Erdős problems previously labeled as open, showing that many were unresolved due to obscurity rather than difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how modern AI systems like Gemini can assist in large-scale mathematical problem solving, and to test whether they can meaningfully contribute to resolving conjectures in a curated database of open Erdős problems. Additionally, to understand practical challenges and risks (like literature search and inadvertent plagiarism) when scaling AI-assisted math discovery.

Method: Systematically process 700 conjectures marked as open in Bloom's Erdős Problems database using a hybrid pipeline. First, use AI-based natural language reasoning and verification to propose solutions or detect potential resolutions, thereby filtering down promising cases. Next, have human mathematical experts carefully examine AI outputs to determine correctness, assess whether solutions are genuinely new, and check against existing mathematical literature.

Result: Out of 700 conjectures, 13 were successfully addressed. Five had what appear to be novel solutions produced autonomously with AI assistance; eight turned out to already be solved in prior literature, which the study was able to identify. The work shows that many of these 'open' problems remained so mainly because prior results were obscure or poorly indexed, not because the problems were inherently difficult. It also surfaced concrete issues related to searching the literature effectively and detecting when AI is reproducing existing arguments without explicit citation.

Conclusion: AI, when combined with expert human oversight, can effectively help reassess and resolve entries in open-problem databases, revealing that some problems are only open by oversight. However, scaling AI to mathematical discovery introduces nontrivial challenges: reliably finding and cross-checking prior work, and guarding against AI-generated solutions that inadvertently mirror existing proofs without proper attribution. These findings underscore both the potential and the limitations of semi-autonomous AI systems in modern mathematical research, and offer lessons for future AI-assisted efforts on similar problem collections.

Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erdős Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erdős Problems.

### [63] [AI-Enabled Waste Classification as a Data-Driven Decision Support Tool for Circular Economy and Urban Sustainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22418)
*Julius Sechang Mboli,Omolara Aderonke Ogungbemi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares traditional ML and deep learning (especially transfer learning) for binary waste image classification, finding DenseNet121 best and integrating it into a real-time waste-sorting decision-support system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve automated waste sorting to support circular economy and reduce landfill and environmental impacts, under practical constraints of limited labeled data and real-time smart-city deployments.

Method: Evaluate multiple traditional ML models (Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost) with and without PCA, and several CNN-based deep-learning models (custom CNNs, VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) on a 25k-image binary waste dataset (80/20 split, augmentation, 150x150 resolution). Compare accuracy and ROC-AUC, and study PCA’s effect and benefits of transfer learning. Discuss embedding best models into a real-time Data-Driven Decision Support System.

Result: DenseNet121 with transfer learning achieved the highest performance (91% accuracy, 0.98 ROC-AUC), beating the best traditional model by about 20 percentage points. PCA did not significantly improve traditional models, while transfer-learning models were notably more robust and effective with limited data.

Conclusion: Transfer-learning-based deep CNNs, especially DenseNet121, are superior to traditional ML and basic CNNs for waste image classification in constrained data scenarios. PCA is unnecessary for classical models here. These models can be effectively integrated into real-time decision-support systems to automate waste sorting and potentially reduce landfill reliance and environmental impacts.

Abstract: Efficient waste sorting is crucial for enabling circular-economy practices and resource recovery in smart cities. This paper evaluates both traditional machine-learning (Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost) and deep-learning techniques including custom CNNs, VGG16, ResNet50, and three transfer-learning models (DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) for binary classification of 25 077 waste images (80/20 train/test split, augmented and resized to 150x150 px). The paper assesses the impact of Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction on traditional models. DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy (91 %) and ROC-AUC (0.98), outperforming the best traditional classifier by 20 pp. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed negligible benefit for classical methods, whereas transfer learning substantially improved performance under limited-data conditions. Finally, we outline how these models integrate into a real-time Data-Driven Decision Support System for automated waste sorting, highlighting potential reductions in landfill use and lifecycle environmental impacts.)

### [64] [When LLM meets Fuzzy-TOPSIS for Personnel Selection through Automated Profile Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22433)
*Shahria Hoque,Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam,Nirjhar Gope*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated system that uses NLP and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to rank software engineering applicants based on LinkedIn-style profile data, achieving rankings that closely match human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face a highly competitive job market and must efficiently identify suitable candidates. Traditional recruitment is time-consuming, subjective, and hard to scale. The authors aim to create an automated, scalable, and less biased recruitment support tool that mimics expert evaluations while handling the ambiguity inherent in human judgments.

Method: They construct a custom dataset from LinkedIn profiles, including education, work experience, skills, and self-introductions, enriched with expert-labeled evaluations. They then develop an LLM-TOPSIS framework that integrates large language models (specifically fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa) with fuzzy TOPSIS, a multi-criteria decision-making method. Triangular fuzzy numbers are used to model uncertain criteria weights and candidate scores, and the combined system produces rankings of applicants across attributes and overall suitability.

Result: The integrated DistilRoBERTa + fuzzy TOPSIS framework generates candidate rankings that align closely with human expert rankings, reaching about 91% accuracy for both Experience and Overall attributes. This indicates that the system can effectively emulate expert decisions in ranking software engineering applicants.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining advanced NLP models with fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making techniques is a promising approach for automated personnel selection. It offers improved scalability, consistency, and potential reduction of bias compared to traditional methods. The authors note that future work should expand the dataset, improve interpretability of the model’s decisions, and validate the framework in real-world recruitment settings to confirm its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: In this highly competitive employment environment, the selection of suitable personnel is essential for organizational success. This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability. This research highlights the intriguing potential of merging NLP with fuzzy decision-making methods in personnel selection, enabling scalable and unbiased solutions to recruitment difficulties.

### [65] [Anytime Safe PAC Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22446)
*Chengyao Yu,Hao Zeng,Youxin Zhu,Jianguo Huang,Huajun Zeng,Bingyi Jing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes B-PAC, a method to safely reduce the use of expensive Large Reasoning Models by selectively routing easy queries to cheaper non-thinking models while keeping performance loss under a user-specified bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models achieve strong performance but are computationally expensive and slow. Existing selective thinking methods that route easy inputs to cheaper models lack reliable error control, especially in online, non-stationary environments with only partial feedback on performance. There is a need for a principled approach that can safely trade off efficiency and accuracy in such settings.

Method: The authors introduce Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, an online selective reasoning framework. It uses inverse propensity scoring to construct test supermartingales for different routing thresholds, enabling anytime-valid statistical tests about whether using a cheaper non-thinking model keeps performance loss within a target level. Based on the accumulating evidence, the method dynamically adjusts the routing threshold to maintain safety while maximizing efficiency.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that B-PAC provides anytime-valid control over performance loss and is statistically efficient. Empirically, across extensive experiments, B-PAC substantially cuts computation, reducing the use of the expensive thinking model by up to 81.01% while keeping the performance degradation below a user-defined limit.

Conclusion: B-PAC reasoning offers a principled and practical solution for safe, efficient deployment of Large Reasoning Models in online settings with partial feedback and non-stationary data. By combining selective routing with martingale-based performance guarantees, it enables large computational savings without exceeding user-specified accuracy loss thresholds.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks but suffer from high computational costs and latency. While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that B-PAC reasoning significantly reduces computational overhead, decreasing thinking model usage by up to 81.01\%, while controlling the performance loss below the user-specified level.

*Tristan Shah,Stas Tiomkin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Controllable Information Production (CIP) as a new intrinsic motivation principle that avoids external rewards and designer-specified variables, by maximizing the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies, connecting optimal control with intrinsic motivation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intrinsic motivation methods in reinforcement learning often rely on external utility functions or information transmission between hand-picked variables (e.g., states, actions, or representations). This introduces design bias and limits generality. The authors want a more principled, self-contained notion of intrinsic motivation that does not depend on arbitrary variable choices yet still leads to rich, controllable behavior. They also wish to formally relate extrinsic (reward-driven) control and intrinsic motivation under a unified optimal control perspective.

Method: They derive a new intrinsic motivation objective, Controllable Information Production (CIP), starting from an optimal control formulation. CIP is mathematically defined as the difference (gap) between closed-loop and open-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropies of the controlled dynamical system. Intuitively, this measures how much additional complexity/chaos the agent can purposefully create and regulate through feedback control compared to passive dynamics. They analyze theoretical properties of this objective and implement algorithms that optimize CIP in reinforcement-learning-style environments, then evaluate on standard intrinsic motivation benchmarks.

Result: The authors prove key theoretical properties of CIP, such as its interpretation in terms of controllable chaos and its connection to traditional optimal control quantities. Empirically, agents optimizing CIP exhibit exploratory and structured behaviors that match or outperform existing intrinsic motivation baselines on standard benchmarks, demonstrating that CIP is an effective intrinsic objective even without external rewards or explicit information-transmission design choices.

Conclusion: Controllable Information Production provides a new, principled way to define intrinsic motivation by quantifying the agent's ability to intentionally generate and control dynamical complexity. It removes dependence on external utilities and designer-specified variables, while being grounded in optimal control theory via KS entropy gaps. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that CIP can serve as a powerful intrinsic drive for exploration and behavior generation in reinforcement learning systems.

Abstract: Intrinsic Motivation (IM) is a paradigm for generating intelligent behavior without external utilities. The existing information-theoretic methods for IM are predominantly based on information transmission, which explicitly depends on the designer's choice of which random variables engage in transmission. In this work, we introduce a novel IM principle, Controllable Information Production (CIP), that avoids both external utilities and designer-specified variables. We derive the CIP objective from Optimal Control, showing a connection between extrinsic and intrinsic behaviors. CIP appears as the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies, which simultaneously rewards the pursuit and regulation of chaos. We establish key theoretical properties of CIP and demonstrate its effectiveness on standard IM benchmarks.

### [67] [Why Self-Rewarding Works: Theoretical Guarantees for Iterative Alignment of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22513)
*Shi Fu,Yingjie Wang,Shengchao Hu,Peng Wang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides the first rigorous theoretical analysis of Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs), proving convergence and performance guarantees for their iterative self-alignment process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although SRLMs have shown strong empirical performance in aligning language models using their own feedback rather than external rewards, the underlying mechanisms and guarantees for why and when they work remain unclear. This lack of theory creates uncertainty about their reliability, limitations, and dependence on initialization. The paper aims to close this gap by giving formal guarantees that explain and predict SRLM behavior.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the update dynamics of SRLMs. They: (1) derive a lower bound on what a single self-reward update can achieve, quantifying how much improvement is fundamentally possible as a function of the initial model’s quality; (2) analyze the full iterative process and prove finite-sample error bounds, tracking how performance scales with the number of samples n and iterations T; (3) study how dependence on the initial model evolves, showing it decays exponentially over iterations; and (4) instantiate the general theory on a concrete linear softmax model class to obtain explicit, architecture-aware guarantees.

Result: The main results show: (1) a single-step lower bound that ties achievable improvement directly to the starting model’s quality; (2) for the iterative procedure, performance error decreases at a rate of order \(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{n})\) with respect to sample size n, under suitable conditions; (3) the influence of the initial model on final performance decays exponentially in the number of iterations T; and (4) for linear softmax models, specialized bounds connect the abstract theory to realistic model classes, validating that the bounds are achievable in a common setting.

Conclusion: Self-rewarding language models are theoretically justified: their iterative self-alignment process provably improves performance with more data and iterations, and the detrimental effect of a poor initialization rapidly diminishes. The analysis explains why SRLMs can successfully align themselves without external rewards by driving the parameter dynamics toward a stable, internally consistent solution. The tailored linear softmax instantiation further grounds these insights in a concrete, practically relevant model class.

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs) achieve notable success in iteratively improving alignment without external feedback. Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.

### [68] [Darwinian Memory: A Training-Free Self-Regulating Memory System for GUI Agent Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22528)
*Hongze Mi,Yibo Feng,WenJie Lu,Song Cao,Jinyuan Li,Yanming Li,Xuelin Zhang,Haotian Luo,Songyang Peng,He Cui,Tengfei Tian,Jun Fang,Hua Chai,Naiqiang Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving memory architecture for MLLM GUI agents, improving long-horizon, cross-application automation without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM agents are promising for GUI automation but fail on long, cross-application tasks because of limited context windows and poorly managed memory. Existing memory paradigms cannot adapt well to dynamic GUI environments, causing a mismatch between high-level goals and low-level actions and leading to context pollution and hallucinations from outdated experiences.

Method: The authors propose DMS, a Darwinian-inspired memory system that treats memory as a dynamic ecosystem. It decomposes long action trajectories into smaller, reusable units, enabling compositional reuse. It uses a Utility-driven Natural Selection mechanism to assign survival value to memory units, pruning low-utility or risky paths and suppressing high-risk plans. This continual selection and pruning drives the emergence of better strategies over time, without modifying the base MLLM architecture or training procedure.

Result: On real-world multi-application GUI benchmarks, DMS significantly improves base MLLM agents, with an average 18.0% increase in task success rate and 33.9% improvement in execution stability, along with reduced task latency. These gains come without additional model training or architectural modifications to the underlying MLLMs.

Conclusion: DMS is an effective, training-free, self-evolving memory system for GUI automation with MLLMs. By decomposing trajectories and applying utility-based natural selection over memory units, it mitigates context pollution, aligns high-level intent with low-level execution, and improves both performance and robustness on long-horizon, cross-application GUI tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents facilitate Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation but struggle with long-horizon, cross-application tasks due to limited context windows. While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.

### [69] [Enhancing TableQA through Verifiable Reasoning Trace Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22530)
*Tung Sum Thomas Kwok,Xinyu Wang,Hengzhi He,Xiaofeng Lin,Peng Lu,Liheng Ma,Chunhe Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Lei Ding,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RE-Tab is a plug-and-play, training-free reward modeling framework that improves multi-step reasoning and efficiency for TableQA agents by giving explicit feedback on table transformation actions, achieving SOTA accuracy with lower inference cost and generalizing across LLMs and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TableQA agents must perform multi-step reasoning over dynamic table states rather than extracting answers from static text or images. Existing approaches struggle with complex table transformations and efficient trajectory search, since they lack explicit, verifiable feedback on whether each intermediate transformation step is correct. This raises the question of whether explicit rewards for table transformation actions can systematically improve reasoning quality and efficiency.

Method: The authors formulate TableQA as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that augments trajectory search using lightweight, training-free reward modeling. RE-Tab injects explicit, verifiable rewards at two stages: (1) State Transition, where it evaluates “What is the best action?” for transforming the table state, and (2) Simulative Reasoning, where it evaluates “Am I sure about the output?” to assess answer reliability. These rewards enforce stepwise reasoning and guide the agent’s navigation through table states without additional model training.

Result: Using RE-Tab, TableQA systems achieve state-of-the-art performance with roughly a 25% reduction in inference cost. When applied in a direct plug-and-play fashion, RE-Tab improves QA accuracy by up to 41.77% and reduces the number of test-time inference samples needed for a consistent answer by 33.33%. Experiments across multiple large language models and standard TableQA benchmarks show consistent gains, indicating the robustness of the approach.

Conclusion: Explicit reward feedback on table transformation and answer verification, operationalized via a POMDP-based reward modeling framework, significantly enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of TableQA agents. RE-Tab can be plugged into existing systems without additional training, delivers state-of-the-art results with reduced inference cost, and generalizes well across different LLM backbones and benchmarks, making it a practical and broadly applicable solution for multi-step TableQA reasoning.

Abstract: A major challenge in training TableQA agents, compared to standard text- and image-based agents, is that answers cannot be inferred from a static input but must be reasoned through stepwise transformations of the table state, introducing multi-step reasoning complexity and environmental interaction. This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability. The repository is available at https://github.com/ThomasK1018/RE_Tab .

### [70] [Decoding in Geometry: Alleviating Embedding-Space Crowding for Complex Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22536)
*Yixin Yang,Qingxiu Dong,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new issue, “embedding-space crowding,” in how LLMs sample next tokens and proposes CraEG, a geometry-aware decoding method that improves reasoning robustness and diversity without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding schemes (temperature, top-k, top-p) only manipulate scalar token probabilities and ignore the geometric structure of token embeddings. The authors observe that during complex reasoning, probability mass tends to concentrate on tokens that are very close in embedding space, which may harm reasoning success. They want to understand this phenomenon, quantify its link to reasoning performance, and design a decoding method that leverages embedding geometry to improve LLM outputs without retraining models.

Method: 1) Empirically analyze next-token distributions in embedding space and define quantitative measures of “embedding-space crowding” at different granularities. 2) Study correlations between these crowding measures and reasoning success on math problem benchmarks. 3) Introduce CraEG, a plug-and-play decoding algorithm that reweights next-token probabilities using geometric information (distances/relationships among token embeddings) to reduce crowding while remaining compatible with standard sampling approaches. 4) Evaluate CraEG across multiple LLMs and reasoning benchmarks, comparing against conventional sampling methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and diversity metrics.

Result: The authors find that LLM next-token distributions often place high probability mass on clusters of geometrically similar tokens, and that this crowding level is statistically associated with reasoning outcomes in math tasks. Applying CraEG reduces such crowding and yields better generation quality: models show improved mathematical reasoning performance, greater robustness across prompts and settings, and increased diversity according to standard metrics, compared to using only traditional probability-based decoding strategies.

Conclusion: Embedding-space structure of token outputs meaningfully affects LLM reasoning behavior. “Embedding-space crowding” is a measurable phenomenon linked to success on reasoning tasks. By explicitly incorporating geometry into decoding via CraEG, one can improve performance, robustness, and diversity without modifying model parameters. Geometry-aware, training-free decoding thus offers a promising new direction for controlling and enhancing LLM behavior beyond scalar probability manipulations alone.

Abstract: Sampling-based decoding underlies complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), where decoding strategies critically shape model behavior. Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies. Experiments on multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate improved generation performance, with gains in robustness and diversity metrics.

### [71] [WED-Net: A Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network with Causal Augmentation for Urban Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22586)
*Qian Hong,Siyuan Chang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes WED-Net, a Transformer-based model that disentangles intrinsic traffic patterns from weather-induced effects to improve spatio-temporal traffic prediction under rare extreme weather conditions, using dual branches, adversarial weather discrimination, and causal data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban traffic prediction becomes particularly difficult under extreme but rare weather conditions like heavy rain, where data are sparse and distributions shift. Existing models mostly use coarse weather inputs and lack mechanisms to capture detailed, dynamic, and causal weather impacts on traffic, limiting robustness and out-of-distribution generalization when extreme events occur.

Method: The authors design WED-Net, a dual-branch Transformer: one branch models intrinsic traffic patterns, and the other models weather-induced patterns. Self-attention and cross-attention are used within and between branches, with memory banks to store representative patterns and an adaptive gating module to fuse the two branches. A discriminator is added to explicitly distinguish weather conditions, encouraging better disentanglement of weather effects. Furthermore, a causal data augmentation strategy perturbs non-causal components of the data while preserving the causal structure, aiming to improve generalization to rare, unseen scenarios.

Result: On taxi-flow datasets from three cities, WED-Net achieves more robust prediction accuracy under extreme weather than baseline methods, demonstrating better generalization to rare weather scenarios and improved handling of fine-grained spatio-temporal weather effects.

Conclusion: Disentangling intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns within a dual-branch Transformer, combined with adversarial weather discrimination and causally motivated data augmentation, significantly improves spatio-temporal urban prediction under extreme weather. This approach enhances robustness and has practical implications for safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience.

Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal prediction under extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain) is challenging due to event rarity and dynamics. Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

### [72] [Learn More with Less: Uncertainty Consistency Guided Query Selection for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22595)
*Hao Yi,Yulan Hu,Xin Li,Sheng Ouyang,Lizhong Ding,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an active learning approach tailored for RL with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve mathematical reasoning in LLMs while cutting annotation costs, by selecting fewer but more informative queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR techniques significantly boost LLM mathematical reasoning but require large query budgets, making human or computational annotation expensive. The authors aim to determine whether careful selection of a smaller subset of informative samples can preserve or improve performance, addressing scalability and cost issues.

Method: The authors integrate active learning into RLVR and analyze why standard active learning heuristics fail: they consider only subjective uncertainty (model’s confidence) and ignore objective uncertainty (true reward/advantage). They propose an "uncertainty consistency" metric that measures alignment between subjective and objective uncertainty. Offline, they quantify this alignment using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, where distributions change and sampling is limited, they design a new online uncertainty consistency metric computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty, and theoretically prove it is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and leads to better query selection.

Result: Empirically, their approach consistently outperforms random sampling and classic active learning strategies in RLVR for reasoning tasks, reaching the same performance as using the full dataset while querying only about 30% of data points, thus lowering RLVR training costs.

Conclusion: By introducing an uncertainty consistency metric and an online variant suitable for RLVR, the paper shows that principled query selection in an active learning framework can greatly reduce annotation/query costs while maintaining or even improving the reasoning performance of LLMs trained with RLVR.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved mathematical reasoning through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.

### [73] [From Self-Evolving Synthetic Data to Verifiable-Reward RL: Post-Training Multi-turn Interactive Tool-Using Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22607)
*Jiaxuan Gao,Jiaao Chen,Chuyi He,Wei-Chen Wang,Shusheng Xu,Hanrui Wang,Di Jin,Yi Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EigenData, a hierarchical multi-agent system plus verifier-based reinforcement learning framework to train interactive tool-using agents using scalable synthetic multi-turn tool-use data, achieving strong performance on real-world benchmarks without heavy human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training interactive tool-using agents for real-world tasks is hard because they must manage dialogue state, execute multi-step tools, and follow complex instructions, but high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is hard to scale and standard RL suffers from noisy signals via user simulation, hurting efficiency. A better, scalable, and reliable way to generate training data and apply RL is needed.

Method: They build EigenData, a hierarchical multi-agent engine that (1) synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues along with executable instance-level checkers; (2) runs a closed-loop self-evolving process that iteratively updates prompts and workflows to improve data quality; and (3) supports a verifier-based RL recipe where they first fine-tune a user model on the synthetic data, then apply GRPO-style reinforcement learning with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering to train the tool-using agent.

Result: Using the synthetic data and RL pipeline, their best model attains 73.0% pass^1 on the Airline domain and 98.3% pass^1 on the Telecom domain of the tau^2-bench benchmark, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art frontier models while relying primarily on synthetic supervision.

Conclusion: A unified, scalable framework that combines a self-evolving synthetic data engine with verifier-based RL can effectively bootstrap complex tool-use behaviors for interactive agents, substantially reducing or eliminating the need for expensive human-labeled multi-turn tool-use data and still achieving frontier-level performance on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Interactive tool-using agents must solve real-world tasks via multi-turn interaction with both humans and external environments, requiring dialogue state tracking, multi-step tool execution, while following complex instructions. Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models. Overall, our results suggest a scalable pathway for bootstrapping complex tool-using behaviors without expensive human annotation.

### [74] [EntroCut: Entropy-Guided Adaptive Truncation for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Small-scale Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22617)
*Hongxi Yan,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large Reasoning Models are made more efficient by stopping their chain-of-thought early when the model is already confident, using output entropy as the signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning in LRMs is computationally expensive. There is a need for methods that save tokens and cost without retraining the model or hurting accuracy too much. The authors observe that early in reasoning, the entropy (uncertainty) of the model’s predictions differs systematically between ultimately correct and incorrect reasoning paths, suggesting entropy could guide when to stop generation.

Method: They analyze the entropy of the model’s output distribution during early reasoning steps and discover it can predict final correctness. Building on this, they propose EntroCut, a training-free dynamic truncation method that monitors entropy during generation and stops the reasoning process once the entropy indicates a high-confidence state. They also introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), which measures how many tokens are saved per unit of accuracy loss, allowing fair comparison of efficiency–accuracy trade-offs across methods.

Result: On four reasoning benchmarks, EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40% while causing only minimal drops in accuracy. Across settings, it yields better efficiency–performance trade-offs (higher EPR) than other training-free truncation or compression baselines.

Conclusion: Entropy of intermediate outputs is a reliable signal of reasoning quality in LRMs. Using this signal for dynamic truncation (EntroCut) can substantially cut computation while preserving accuracy, offering a practical, training-free way to make LRMs more efficient in real-world use.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks through extended chain-of-thought generation, but their reliance on lengthy intermediate steps incurs substantial computational cost. We find that the entropy of the model's output distribution in early reasoning steps reliably distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose EntroCut, a training-free method that dynamically truncates reasoning by identifying high-confidence states where reasoning can be safely terminated. To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods. These results demonstrate that entropy-guided dynamic truncation provides a practical approach to mitigate the inefficiency of LRMs.

### [75] [SYMPHONY: Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous Language Model Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22623)
*Wei Zhu,Zhiwen Tang,Kun Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SYMPHONY is a multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search planning framework that uses a heterogeneous pool of LLM-based agents to improve exploration diversity and planning performance over standard single-agent LLM planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based planning methods rely on a single agent to generate search branches and estimate rewards in MCTS, which constrains exploration and leads to low diversity in candidate plans and suboptimal outcomes. There is a need for a planning framework that can better exploit varied reasoning styles of different LLMs to enhance exploration and decision quality, ideally while remaining practical on consumer hardware and scalable with stronger cloud models.

Method: The paper introduces SYMPHONY, a multi-agent planning framework that plugs multiple heterogeneous LLM-based agents into the MCTS pipeline. Different LLMs (open-source and cloud-based) act as distinct agents with diverse reasoning patterns, jointly generating rollouts and evaluations for tree search. The system coordinates these agents to expand search branches and estimate rewards, effectively increasing rollout diversity and improving exploration during planning, without being restricted to a single model’s reasoning style.

Result: On multiple benchmark tasks, SYMPHONY attains strong performance using only open-source LLMs that can run on consumer-grade hardware, already matching or surpassing many existing methods. When augmented with more powerful cloud-based LLMs accessed via API, it achieves further gains and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that heterogeneous multi-agent assemblies can significantly improve planning quality in LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous multi-agent coordination among LLMs within an MCTS-based planning framework leads to richer exploration and better planning outcomes than single-agent LLM planners. SYMPHONY shows that combining diverse open-source and cloud LLMs in a unified planning system is both practical and highly effective, suggesting multi-agent heterogeneity is a promising direction for future LLM-based planning research.

Abstract: Recent advancements have increasingly focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to construct autonomous agents for complex problem-solving tasks. However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.

### [76] [Statistical Estimation of Adversarial Risk in Large Language Models under Best-of-N Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22636)
*Mingqian Feng,Xiaodong Liu,Weiwei Yang,Chenliang Xu,Christopher White,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SABER, a method to accurately estimate large-scale adversarial jailbreak risk for LLMs from small-sample evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM safety evaluations rely on single-shot or low-budget attacks, which underestimate real-world risk where attackers can perform many parallel queries until the model fails. There is a need for a principled, low-cost way to predict how jailbreak success scales as the number of samples (Best-of-N attacks) increases.

Method: They propose SABER (scaling-aware Best-of-N Estimation of Risk), which models the per-sample attack success probability with a Beta distribution (conjugate prior to the Bernoulli). From this, they derive an analytic scaling law that predicts attack success rates for large N (e.g., 1000 samples) using only small-N empirical data (e.g., 100 samples). The estimator is "anchored" using observed data to calibrate the Beta parameters and then extrapolate risk under Best-of-N sampling.

Result: Using only n=100 adversarial samples, SABER predicts the attack success rate at N=1000 (ASR@1000) with a mean absolute error of 1.66, versus 12.04 for a baseline estimator, representing an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. The analysis also reveals that different models show heterogeneous and sometimes highly nonlinear scaling of risk under increasing adversarial sampling.

Conclusion: SABER offers a low-cost, scalable, and statistically principled way to estimate large-scale jailbreak risk of LLMs from limited adversarial evaluations. It shows that models that look safe under standard, low-budget evaluations may still be vulnerable under large-scale parallel attacks due to nonlinear risk amplification, underscoring the need for scaling-aware safety assessments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.

*Vaibhav Ram S. V. N. S,Swetanshu Agrawal,Samudra Banerjee,Abdul Muhsin*

TL;DR: The paper argues that current generative medical AI systems, which treat medicine as a text-generation task, are structurally misaligned with real clinical reasoning needs. It proposes a new capability class, Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI), and introduces Meddollina, a governance-first system that prioritizes safe, context-aware clinical support over fluent generation, showing improved behaviour under uncertainty across a large benchmark of medical queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models appear fluent and knowledgeable in medical contexts, leading to optimism that simply scaling these systems will yield safe clinical AI. However, clinical reasoning fundamentally differs from text generation: it must operate under ambiguity, incomplete and evolving evidence, and over long time horizons, with serious consequences for errors. The authors are motivated by persistent unsafe behaviours in generation-centric systems—such as overconfidence, premature conclusions, and unstable multi-step reasoning—that remain even as benchmark scores improve, indicating a structural mismatch that must be addressed for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors first conceptualise and formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class for medical AI, characterised by persistent context awareness, preservation of clinical intent, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is lacking. They then design and implement Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system that constrains inference before natural language output, acting as a continuous intelligence layer embedded in clinical workflows and explicitly preserving clinician authority. To assess it, they use a behaviour-first evaluation regime across more than 16,412 diverse medical queries, comparing Meddollina’s behavioural properties against general-purpose LLMs, medically fine-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.

Result: Meddollina demonstrates a behavioural profile that is notably different from traditional generation-centric models. It displays calibrated uncertainty rather than unwarranted confidence, adopts conservative reasoning when clinical information is underspecified, maintains stable adherence to constraints over longitudinal interactions, and reduces speculative or hallucinated content. In comparisons across 16,412+ medical queries, these behaviours are more aligned with clinical expectations than those of general-purpose, medical-tuned, or retrieval-augmented baselines, suggesting improved safety and reliability characteristics for clinical support.

Conclusion: The study concludes that safe, deployable medical AI is unlikely to emerge simply from scaling up generative models that treat medicine as next-token prediction. Instead, progress requires a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence (CCI), where systems are evaluated and optimised for clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty, context preservation, and responsible deferral, rather than for fluent or exhaustive text generation. Meddollina is presented as an initial realisation of this paradigm, illustrating how a governance-first, inference-constraining design can yield more clinically appropriate behaviour and pointing toward a new direction for medical AI development and evaluation.

Abstract: Generative medical AI now appears fluent and knowledgeable enough to resemble clinical intelligence, encouraging the belief that scaling will make it safe. But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.
  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.
  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.
  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.

### [78] [Test-Time Mixture of World Models for Embodied Agents in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22647)
*Jinwoo Jang,Minjong Yoo,Sihyung Yoon,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes TMoW, a test-time Mixture-of-World-Models framework that allows LM-based embodied agents to adapt in dynamic, unseen environments by updating routing over multiple world models during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LM-based embodied agents struggle to adapt to dynamic or unseen domains because their underlying world models and Mixture-of-Experts routing are fixed after training. This rigidity prevents effective recombination of knowledge and rapid incorporation of new domain information, which is essential for robust reasoning and decision-making in real-world tasks.

Method: The authors extend the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm to embodied agents via TMoW, which enables test-time-updatable routing over multiple world models. The method has three main components: (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing that selects and mixes experts using similarities from object level up to scene level, (ii) test-time refinement that adjusts domain features to better align with learned prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation that creates new world models from few-shot data by distilling knowledge from existing prototypes and mixtures.

Result: On the VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, TMoW shows strong performance for zero-shot adaptation to new domains and for few-shot expansion when limited new data is available, outperforming or matching baselines that lack adaptive routing of world models.

Conclusion: Allowing the routing over world models to be updated at test time, and equipping it with prototype-based, multi-granular reasoning and distillation mechanisms, significantly improves the adaptability of LM-based embodied agents in dynamic and unseen environments, enabling more robust operation with minimal additional data.

Abstract: Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.

### [79] [UCPO: Uncertainty-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22648)
*Xianzhou Zeng,Jing Huang,Chunmei Xie,Gongrui Nan,Siye Chen,Mengyu Lu,Weiqi Xiong,Qixuan Zhou,Junhao Zhang,Qiang Zhu,Yadong Li,Xingzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes UCPO, a new RL framework to make LLMs express and use uncertainty more reliably, reducing hallucinations and over/under-confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods used to train LLMs with uncertainty-based rewards (like GRPO variants) suffer from 'Advantage Bias' because they only treat outputs as binary (good/bad) and use fixed uncertainty rewards. This leads models to become either too conservative (avoiding answers) or overconfident (hallucinating), which is especially harmful in high-stakes applications. The authors want to understand why reward hacking and overconfidence arise and to design a principled RL method that calibrates confidence and uncertainty properly.

Method: They analyze the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in existing RL frameworks that incorporate uncertainty-based rewards. Based on this, they propose UCPO (UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization). UCPO introduces (1) Ternary Advantage Decoupling, which separates and independently normalizes deterministic, uncertain, and presumably incorrect rollouts to remove advantage bias; and (2) Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment, which adaptively adjusts the weight of uncertainty rewards in real-time according to the training stage (model evolution) and per-instance difficulty, instead of using static uncertainty weights.

Result: On mathematical reasoning benchmarks and more general tasks, UCPO corrects reward imbalances seen in prior methods, leading to better-calibrated uncertainty and more reliable behavior beyond the model’s training/knowledge boundaries. The experiments show that UCPO reduces hallucinations and improves both reliability and calibration compared to baselines such as GRPO-style approaches.

Conclusion: Equipping LLM training with the UCPO framework—via ternary advantage decoupling and dynamic uncertainty reward adjustment—can alleviate advantage bias, mitigate reward hacking and overconfidence, and significantly enhance the trustworthiness and uncertainty calibration of LLMs in challenging reasoning and general tasks.

Abstract: The key to building trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in endowing them with inherent uncertainty expression capabilities to mitigate the hallucinations that restrict their high-stakes applications. However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.

### [80] [Task-Aware LLM Council with Adaptive Decision Pathways for Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22662)
*Wei Zhu,Lixing Yu,Hao-Ren Yao,Zhiwen Tang,Kun Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TALC, a framework that coordinates multiple specialized LLMs using MCTS and success memories to adaptively choose the best model and plan actions for each task step, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based decision-making methods typically treat all large language models as interchangeable, ignoring that different models may excel at different tasks or reasoning patterns. This uniform treatment prevents systems from fully leveraging model specialization and adapting to varying task complexity, leading to suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning and planning scenarios.

Method: The authors propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), which forms a council of specialized LLMs and integrates them with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each LLM is given a structured success memory profile built from previous successful task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current context and past successes. During search, at each decision node, TALC (1) selects the most contextually appropriate LLM based on this memory profile, and (2) estimates node value via a dual-signal mechanism that combines current model evaluation with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted according to intra-node variance and then used in MCTS selection and expansion, thus jointly optimizing model routing and planning strategy.

Result: On three benchmarks—WebShop (web-based decision-making), HumanEval (code generation), and Game of 24 (arithmetic reasoning)—TALC outperforms strong baseline methods in both task success rate and search efficiency, indicating better solution quality with fewer search steps or model calls.

Conclusion: TALC demonstrates that explicitly modeling and exploiting specialization across multiple LLMs, coupled with adaptive MCTS-based planning and memory-guided routing, yields significant gains in multi-step reasoning tasks. The framework shows that task-aware expert selection and variance-aware value estimation can improve both performance and computational efficiency, supporting the value of council-style, specialization-aware LLM systems for complex decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse decision-making tasks. However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.

### [81] [Real-Time Aligned Reward Model beyond Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22664)
*Zixuan Huang,Xin Xia,Yuxi Ren,Jianbin Zheng,Xuefeng Xiao,Hongyan Xie,Li Huaqiu,Songshi Liang,Zhongxiang Dai,Fuzhen Zhuang,Jianxin Li,Yikun Ban,Deqing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes R2M, a lightweight RLHF framework that updates reward models in real time using policy hidden states to better track distribution shift and reduce reward overoptimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF reward models often become misaligned with the policy as training progresses, causing reward overoptimization where the policy exploits spurious reward patterns instead of capturing human intent. Existing solutions mainly use static semantic representations and don’t adapt effectively to continuous policy distribution shifts, leading to increasing reward discrepancies.

Method: Introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), which augments the reward model with policy feedback by incorporating the evolving hidden states of the policy model during RL training. Instead of relying solely on fixed semantic representations from a pretrained LLM, R2M dynamically conditions the reward model on these policy hidden states to track real-time distribution shifts.

Result: R2M is presented as a lightweight framework that better aligns the reward model with the current policy distribution, thereby reducing reward overoptimization compared with vanilla RLHF setups that use static reward models. (Specific metrics are not provided in the abstract.)

Conclusion: Real-time integration of policy feedback into the reward model is a promising direction for mitigating reward overoptimization in RLHF, offering better alignment with human intent as the policy evolves during training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it is susceptible to reward overoptimization, in which policy models overfit to the reward model, exploit spurious reward patterns instead of faithfully capturing human intent. Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.

### [82] [Best-of-Q: Improving VLM agents with Q-function Action Ranking at Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22701)
*Emilien Biré,María Santos,Kai Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose a way to improve vision-language web agents at inference time using a frozen VLM for action proposals plus a separate Q-function to re-rank and select actions, yielding big success-rate gains without retraining the main model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language agents operating in dynamic digital environments like the web quickly become outdated, and standard adaptation via fine-tuning is expensive and slow, requiring new data collection and full policy retraining. The authors want a cheaper, faster way to make existing VLM-based agents adapt and perform better without touching the large backbone.

Method: They freeze the VLM policy and repurpose it purely as a high-capacity action proposer: given a state, it generates multiple candidate actions. Separately, they train a lightweight Q-function offline to estimate the value of state–action pairs. At inference, instead of executing the VLM’s top suggestion, they pass all candidate actions through the Q-function, re-rank them by predicted value, and execute the highest-value action. Crucially, the Q-function is used directly for reranking during inference rather than as an offline relabeling tool for further policy training.

Result: On the WebVoyager benchmark, the reranking scheme significantly improves task success. A Qwen2.5-VL-7B-based agent’s success rate rises from 38.8% to 55.7%, and a GPT-4.1-based agent improves from 82.4% to 88.8%, demonstrating consistent gains across both open and proprietary VLM backbones.

Conclusion: Decoupling action proposal (handled by a frozen VLM) from action selection (handled by a small, offline-trained Q-function) enables immediate, inference-time improvement of vision-language agents in web environments without costly policy retraining. This paradigm offers a practical path to keep VLM-based agents effective in fast-changing digital settings while leveraging existing large models as-is.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become powerful backbones for agents to autonomously operate in digital environments like the web and operating systems. However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.

### [83] [A Step Back: Prefix Importance Ratio Stabilizes Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22718)
*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They analyze off-policy reinforcement learning for LLM post-training, identify instability from token-level importance sampling, and propose MinPRO, a new objective using minimum prefix ratios to stabilize training and improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-policy RL is used for efficiency in LLM post-training, but current practice uses token-level importance sampling corrections that become unstable when the sampling and target policies differ significantly. This instability limits reliable scaling of RL-based reasoning improvements in LLMs.

Method: (1) Theoretically analyze policy optimization for LLMs under off-policy data and show that the correct IS correction should use prefix importance ratios, not token-level ones. (2) Empirically study how token-level corrections behave with large off-policy drift and document instability. (3) Propose MinPRO, which replaces the cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate constructed from the minimum token-level ratio in the prefix, thus bounding variance and improving stability. (4) Evaluate MinPRO on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs on several math reasoning benchmarks in off-policy training settings.

Result: MinPRO leads to significantly more stable training curves and higher peak performance compared with standard token-level IS-based RL objectives when rollouts are highly off-policy. These gains are observed consistently on various math reasoning datasets and across both dense and MoE LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Using token-level importance sampling for off-policy correction in RL post-training of LLMs is theoretically mismatched and empirically unstable at high off-policy drift. A prefix-based perspective reveals why, and the proposed MinPRO objective, which uses a minimum prefix ratio surrogate, offers a simple, robust alternative that stabilizes training and improves reasoning performance in practice.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has increasingly demonstrated strong ability to elicit reasoning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.

### [84] [AutoRefine: From Trajectories to Reusable Expertise for Continual LLM Agent Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22758)
*Libin Qiu,Zhirong Gao,Junfu Chen,Yuhang Ye,Weizhi Huang,Xiaobo Xue,Wenkai Qiu,Shuo Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoRefine is a framework that lets LLM agents automatically extract, structure, and maintain reusable experience from past executions in both procedural (subagents) and static (skills) forms, preventing knowledge-base degradation and improving performance and efficiency on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents typically do not learn effectively from experience: they treat each task in isolation, and current experience-extraction methods flatten histories into text snippets that miss procedural logic and inter-step coordination. Moreover, as more experience accumulates, these flat repositories become noisy, redundant, and hard to maintain, which can even hurt performance. The authors aim to design a system that captures both how to do multi-step subtasks and what static knowledge is helpful, while keeping this experience repository clean and scalable over time.

Method: The authors propose AutoRefine, which processes agent execution histories to extract dual-form "Experience Patterns": (1) procedural patterns, instantiated as specialized subagents with their own reasoning and memory for recurring subtasks; and (2) static skill patterns, expressed as guidelines or code snippets for recurring knowledge or tricks. AutoRefine incorporates a continuous maintenance pipeline that scores each pattern, prunes low-value or obsolete ones, and merges overlapping patterns to control redundancy and preserve quality as the repository grows. The system is plugged into LLM agents and iteratively updated as they solve tasks.

Result: On three benchmarks—ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner—AutoRefine significantly improves task success rates and efficiency. It reaches 98.4% success on ALFWorld, 70.4% on ScienceWorld, and 27.1% on TravelPlanner, while reducing the number of action steps by 20–73% across tasks. On the most complex benchmark, TravelPlanner, automatically extracted experience patterns outperform a manually engineered experience system (27.1% vs 12.1% success), indicating superior capture of procedural coordination between subtasks.

Conclusion: AutoRefine shows that LLM agents can automatically learn both procedural and static knowledge from their own execution histories if that experience is structured into "Experience Patterns" and actively maintained. Dual-form patterns and continuous scoring/pruning/merging prevent repository degradation and support better coordination on complex tasks, sometimes surpassing hand-designed systems. This suggests a path toward more scalable, self-improving LLM agents that accumulate and refine skills over time.

Abstract: Large language model agents often fail to accumulate knowledge from experience, treating each task as an independent challenge. Recent methods extract experience as flattened textual knowledge, which cannot capture procedural logic of complex subtasks. They also lack maintenance mechanisms, causing repository degradation as experience accumulates. We introduce AutoRefine, a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories. For procedural subtasks, we extract specialized subagents with independent reasoning and memory. For static knowledge, we extract skill patterns as guidelines or code snippets. A continuous maintenance mechanism scores, prunes, and merges patterns to prevent repository degradation. Evaluated on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner, AutoRefine achieves 98.4%, 70.4%, and 27.1% respectively, with 20-73% step reductions. On TravelPlanner, automatic extraction exceeds manually designed systems (27.1% vs 12.1%), demonstrating its ability to capture procedural coordination.

### [85] [TSPO: Breaking the Double Homogenization Dilemma in Multi-turn Search Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22776)
*Shichao Ma,Zhiyuan Ma,Ming Yang,Xiaofan Li,Xing Wu,Jintao Du,Yu Cheng,Weiqiang Wang,Qiliang Liu,Zhengyang Zhou,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new RL framework, TSPO, for tool-using LLMs that assigns turn-level rewards when the correct answer first appears, alleviating homogenization issues from sparse, outcome-only rewards and improving performance on Qwen2.5 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL for search-augmented, multi-turn LLM reasoning uses only sparse, final-outcome rewards. This causes two problems: (1) process homogenization, where all intermediate reasoning steps and tool calls are ignored in training signals; (2) intra-group homogenization, where coarse, trajectory-level rewards make it hard for group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO to correctly estimate which sampled trajectories are better within a batch, limiting learning efficiency and performance.

Method: They introduce Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO operates at the turn level in multi-step reasoning and incorporates a First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism. FOLR assigns a partial reward to the specific step (turn) where the model first produces the ground-truth answer in its reasoning trajectory. This creates denser, stage-aware rewards without needing external reward models or additional annotations, and increases variance of rewards across trajectories within GRPO-style groups, improving credit assignment among sampled rollouts.

Result: In experiments on tool-integrated reasoning tasks with Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B, TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL baselines. Reported average performance gains are 24% for the 3B model and 13.6% for the 7B model, indicating better reasoning and tool-use capabilities under the proposed training scheme.

Conclusion: Turn-level, stage-aware rewards via FOLR effectively mitigate the double homogenization dilemma in RL for multi-turn, tool-augmented LLM reasoning. By providing process-level credit assignment and enhancing intra-group reward variability without extra supervision, TSPO yields substantial performance improvements over existing outcome-level RL methods, suggesting that finer-grained reward design is crucial for advancing search-augmented LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks through iterative information retrieval. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for search-augmented reasoning predominantly rely on sparse outcome-level rewards, leading to a "Double Homogenization Dilemma." This manifests as (1) Process homogenization, where the thinking, reasoning, and tooling involved in generation are ignored. (2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.

### [86] [Learning with Challenges: Adaptive Difficulty-Aware Data Generation for Mobile GUI Agent Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22781)
*Linjia Kang,Zhimin Wang,Yongkang Zhang,Duo Wu,Jinghe Wang,Ming Ma,Haopeng Yan,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MobileGen is a data generation framework that adaptively matches GUI training task difficulty to an agent’s current capability frontier, yielding better training trajectories and higher benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent training data are generated either by humans or through automated exploration, but they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This causes a mismatch between the difficulty of training tasks and the evolving capabilities of the agent, which limits learning efficiency and performance. The authors want a way to systematically control and adapt task difficulty so that agents learn in a curriculum-like fashion.

Method: MobileGen first decomposes task difficulty into two dimensions: structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., complexity of task goal). It evaluates a GUI agent on a curated prior dataset to map out its capability frontier across these dimensions. Based on this capability profile, it adaptively computes a probability distribution over task difficulties and samples target difficulty levels for the next training round. A multi-agent controllable generator then uses these difficulty targets to synthesize new high-quality interaction trajectories and corresponding task instructions for training.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple challenging GUI benchmarks show that training agents with data generated by MobileGen significantly improves performance compared with existing data generation baselines, achieving on average a 1.57× performance gain. The experiments validate that capability-aligned, difficulty-controlled data leads to more effective GUI agent training.

Conclusion: Aligning data generation with an agent’s evolving capability frontier along both structural and semantic difficulty dimensions enables more efficient and effective training of mobile GUI agents. MobileGen’s adaptive curriculum-like approach to trajectory generation yields consistently better performance than prior static or uncontrolled data generation methods, underscoring the value of capability-aware training data design for GUI agents.

Abstract: Large-scale, high-quality interaction trajectories are essential for advancing mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.

### [87] [Toward IIT-Inspired Consciousness in LLMs: A Reward-Based Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22786)
*Hamid Reza Akbari,Mohammad Hossein Sameti,Amir M. Mansourian,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Hossein Sameti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Implements an Integrated Information Theory (IIT)-inspired reward to post-train LLMs, yielding shorter but equally accurate outputs and additional calibration benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGI development may benefit from consciousness-like processing. While LLMs are not conscious, they show behavior reminiscent of aspects of consciousness. A practical way is sought to incorporate a leading, formal theory of consciousness—Integrated Information Theory—into language model training, both to explore its implications and to improve model efficiency and behavior without extra data or complex pipelines.

Method: Translate core ideas from IIT (causality, coherence, integration) into a scalar reward function over generated text. Use this reward in a post-training, reward-based learning setup to steer a language model toward outputs that score higher on these measures. Evaluate on in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, examining not only task accuracy but also output length, confidence calibration, and test-time scaling behavior. No external datasets or auxiliary models are used; the reward is derived from the model and text properties themselves.

Result: Optimizing for the IIT-inspired reward makes the model produce more concise texts. On out-of-domain tasks, tuning the reward yields up to a 31% reduction in output length while maintaining accuracy at roughly the same level as the base model. Additional analyses show changes in model confidence calibration and in how computation is used at test time, suggesting broader behavioral shifts beyond simple length reduction.

Conclusion: An IIT-inspired reward can be practically implemented in LLM post-training and leads to more concise generation without sacrificing accuracy, while also affecting calibration and computational behavior. The framework is simple, data- and model-efficient, and uses a general capability-oriented signal instead of task-specific heuristics, suggesting a promising direction for leveraging formal theories of consciousness to guide LLM training and behavior.

Abstract: The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a central goal in language model development, in which consciousness-like processing could serve as a key facilitator. While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

### [88] [Conditional Performance Guarantee for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22790)
*Jianguo Huang,Hao Zeng,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces G-PAC and C-PAC, frameworks that bring PAC-style statistical guarantees to large reasoning models at the group level, improving efficiency while controlling risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models are powerful but computationally expensive because they often rely on long chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing PAC reasoning methods offer efficiency with statistical guarantees by switching between heavy "thinking" models and cheaper models, but they only ensure guarantees marginally over all data, not conditionally within subgroups. This lack of conditional coverage is problematic in heterogeneous data where different subgroups may have different risks or behaviors.

Method: The authors propose G-PAC reasoning, which partitions the input space into groups and enforces PAC-style guarantees at the group level. For settings where group structure is known (e.g., task types or difficulty bands), they introduce Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning. For settings where group structure is unknown, they propose Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning, which discovers groups via clustering. Both methods define policies for when to use a costly reasoning model versus a cheaper one, calibrated to achieve target risk thresholds within each group. They provide formal proofs that these procedures achieve group-conditional risk control.

Result: Theoretical results show that G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk guarantees and can be more sample and computation efficient than marginal PAC reasoning, especially in heterogeneous environments where subgroup risks differ. Empirically, across several reasoning benchmarks, both methods maintain desired risk levels per group while significantly reducing calls to the expensive reasoning model, leading to notable computational savings without sacrificing accuracy guarantees.

Conclusion: By moving from marginal to group-conditional guarantees, G-PAC and C-PAC provide more fine-grained and reliable control of reasoning errors while reducing computation. Grouping—either using known group labels or learned clusters—can strictly improve efficiency over existing PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings, making large reasoning models more practical and trustworthy for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have shown strong performance through extended chain-of-thought reasoning, yet their computational cost remains significant. Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings. Our experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that G-PAC and C-PAC successfully achieve group-conditional risk control while maintaining substantial computational savings.

### [89] [CVeDRL: An Efficient Code Verifier via Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22803)
*Ji Shi,Peiming Guo,Meishan Zhang,Miao Zhang,Xuebo Liu,Min Zhang,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CVeDRL, a reinforcement learning framework to train LLM-based code verifiers that generate better unit tests, achieving higher pass rates and branch coverage than larger models like GPT-3.5 with much faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based code verifiers rely on supervised fine-tuning using labeled data, which is scarce, leads to high failure rates, and is computationally inefficient at inference. Naive RL approaches that only reward functional correctness (e.g., passing tests) fail to produce effective unit tests for hard branches and difficult samples. There is a need for a principled RL formulation that incorporates richer signals to improve verification reliability and efficiency.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze how multiple aspects—branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic correctness, and functional correctness—can be jointly modeled as reinforcement learning rewards. Based on this, they design syntax- and functionality-aware reward functions and introduce branch- and sample-difficulty–aware RL via exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. This RL formulation is used to train a 0.6B-parameter code verifier, CVeDRL, that generates unit tests for post-verification of LLM-generated code.

Result: CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance among code verifiers with only 0.6B parameters. It obtains up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while also being more than 20 times faster at inference compared to competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Carefully designed reinforcement learning with multi-faceted rewards (syntax, functionality, branch coverage, and difficulty-aware shaping) can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based code verifiers. CVeDRL demonstrates that smaller, RL-trained verifiers can outperform larger general-purpose models like GPT-3.5 in unit-test-based code verification tasks, offering a practical path toward reliable and efficient automatic code checking.

Abstract: Code verifiers play a critical role in post-verification for LLM-based code generation, yet existing supervised fine-tuning methods suffer from data scarcity, high failure rates, and poor inference efficiency. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

### [90] [Aligning the Unseen in Attributed Graphs: Interplay between Graph Geometry and Node Attributes Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22806)
*Aldric Labarthe,Roland Bouffanais,Julien Randon-Furling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that standard representation learning on attributed graphs is geometrically flawed and proposes a VAE that decouples manifold learning from structural alignment, using metric distortion to reveal hidden structural patterns and anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning node representations on attributed graphs jointly reconstruct node attributes and graph structure in a single latent space. This implicitly assumes that the attribute space and the structural space are geometrically compatible, which may not hold. The resulting forced alignment can destroy information about the true generative process of the graph. The authors are motivated to recover this lost information and to turn geometric incompatibility into a useful signal for understanding graph structure.

Method: They design a specialized variational autoencoder architecture that explicitly separates two tasks: (1) learning the intrinsic manifold of node attributes, and (2) aligning this manifold to the graph’s structural space. The structural space is characterized via the graph’s Heat Kernel, which captures connectivity patterns. They then quantify the metric distortion required to map the learned attribute manifold onto the Heat Kernel geometry. This distortion is treated as a new, interpretable descriptor of structural properties and irregularities in the graph.

Result: Empirical experiments show that the proposed approach reveals connectivity patterns and anomalies in graphs that standard joint-reconstruction methods fail to detect. These findings provide evidence that conventional approaches are both theoretically unsound in their geometric assumptions and practically limited in their ability to capture important structural signals.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that merging attribute and structural spaces into a single latent geometry is fundamentally flawed for attributed graph representation learning. By decoupling manifold learning from structural alignment and explicitly measuring the induced metric distortion, one can both preserve information about the underlying generative process and obtain a powerful structural descriptor that exposes patterns and anomalies overlooked by existing methods.

Abstract: The standard approach to representation learning on attributed graphs -- i.e., simultaneously reconstructing node attributes and graph structure -- is geometrically flawed, as it merges two potentially incompatible metric spaces. This forces a destructive alignment that erodes information about the graph's underlying generative process. To recover this lost signal, we introduce a custom variational autoencoder that separates manifold learning from structural alignment. By quantifying the metric distortion needed to map the attribute manifold onto the graph's Heat Kernel, we transform geometric conflict into an interpretable structural descriptor. Experiments show our method uncovers connectivity patterns and anomalies undetectable by conventional approaches, proving both their theoretical inadequacy and practical limitations.

### [91] [Game-Theoretic Co-Evolution for LLM-Based Heuristic Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22896)
*Xinyi Ke,Kai Li,Junliang Xing,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASRO reframes heuristic discovery as a game between solvers and instance generators, using LLM-based best responses to co-evolve both sides and improve generalization beyond static training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic heuristic discovery with LLMs typically evaluates and trains heuristics on static, fixed instance distributions. This encourages overfitting and yields heuristics that can fail under distribution shifts or on out-of-distribution problem instances. There is a need for a framework that actively and adaptively challenges discovered heuristics, promoting robustness and broad generalization.

Method: Introduce ASRO, which casts the interaction between a solver (heuristic/program) and an instance generator as a two-player zero-sum game. It maintains growing pools of solver strategies and instance-generation strategies. Using LLMs as best-response oracles, the system iteratively adds new solver programs and new challenging instances by optimizing against mixed meta-strategies over the existing pools. This creates an adaptive curriculum of increasingly challenging instances and improved solvers instead of training against a fixed distribution.

Result: Across several combinatorial optimization tasks, ASRO-based automatic heuristic discovery surpasses baselines that rely on static training distributions but use comparable program search mechanisms. Empirically, heuristics discovered via ASRO generalize better and are more robust, especially on diverse and out-of-distribution problem instances.

Conclusion: Viewing heuristic discovery as a game and co-evolving both solvers and instance generators with LLM best-response oracles leads to more robust, better-generalizing heuristics than static-distribution training. The ASRO framework offers a principled, adaptive curriculum for automatic heuristic discovery in combinatorial optimization and potentially beyond.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled rapid progress in automatic heuristic discovery (AHD), yet most existing methods are predominantly limited by static evaluation against fixed instance distributions, leading to potential overfitting and poor generalization under distributional shifts. We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.

### [92] [MulFeRL: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Verbal Feedback in a Multi-turn Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22900)
*Xuancheng Li,Haitao Li,Yujia Zhou,YiqunLiu,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They extend RL with verifiable rewards by adding multi-turn, verbal feedback-guided regeneration, turning rich textual feedback on failed reasoning attempts into effective learning signals that improve math reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL with scalar, outcome-only rewards (success/failure) is too sparse and uninformative, especially for failed reasoning traces, giving the model no signal about *why* it failed or how to improve. Since many domains—like mathematical reasoning—can provide richer, verifiable textual feedback, the authors aim to exploit that feedback to drive more sample-efficient and targeted learning, particularly from failures.

Method: They introduce a multi-turn, feedback-guided RL framework on top of RL with verifiable rewards. The key components are: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration triggered only when a sample fails, where the model receives verbal feedback and regenerates its reasoning; (2) two complementary optimization signals—one for improving reasoning within a single turn using the feedback, and one for improving across multiple turns by leveraging the sequence of feedback-regeneration steps; and (3) structured injection of feedback directly into the model’s intermediate reasoning, so that feedback shapes the chain-of-thought rather than only the final answer. They train and evaluate this on OpenR1-Math samples.

Result: When trained on sampled OpenR1-Math, the proposed framework outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and standard RLVR baselines on in-domain math reasoning tasks, and it also transfers well to out-of-domain settings, indicating better generalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured, multi-turn verbal feedback into RL with verifiable rewards enables models to learn more effectively from failed reasoning attempts. By turning rich feedback into explicit within- and cross-turn learning signals and injecting it into the reasoning process, the method achieves superior performance and generalization over traditional outcome-only RLVR and supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is widely used to improve reasoning in multiple domains, yet outcome-only scalar rewards are often sparse and uninformative, especially on failed samples, where they merely indicate failure and provide no insight into why the reasoning fails. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process. Trained on sampled OpenR1-Math, the approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RLVR baselines in-domain and generalizes well out-of-domain.

### [93] [Alignment among Language, Vision and Action Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22948)
*Nicola Milano,Stefano Nolfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tests whether internal representations from language, vision, and action learning converge, finding strong cross-modal alignment between action-grounded embeddings and several language/vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer whether agents trained in different modalities (language, vision, embodied action) end up learning distinct, non-transferable representations or whether they share a common semantic structure, especially in embodied action settings that are less explored than pure language or vision-language models.

Method: Train a transformer-based agent via behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform to execute goal-directed actions from natural language instructions, obtaining action-grounded language embeddings. Then quantitatively compare these embeddings with representations from multiple large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP) using alignment metrics such as precision@15, analyzing how similar their representational geometries are.

Result: Action-based representations strongly align with decoder-only LLMs and the BLIP vision-language model (precision@15: 0.70–0.73), nearly matching alignment levels observed among language models themselves, whereas alignment with CLIP and BERT is much weaker.

Conclusion: Representations learned from action, language, and vision partially converge onto shared semantic structures, suggesting a modality-independent semantic organization and indicating that knowledge learned in one modality can potentially transfer to others in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.

### [94] [EvoClinician: A Self-Evolving Agent for Multi-Turn Medical Diagnosis via Test-Time Evolutionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22964)
*Yufei He,Juncheng Liu,Zhiyuan Hu,Yulin Chen,Yue Liu,Yuan Sui,Yibo Li,Nuo Chen,Jun Hu,Bryan Hooi,Xinxing Xu,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-Inquire, a benchmark for multi-turn medical diagnosis, and EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies during test time, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most medical AI systems assume a one-shot diagnosis using a full patient file, which is unrealistic compared to real clinical practice where diagnosis is an iterative, multi-turn process involving sequential questions and tests under cost and time constraints. There is a need for benchmarks and methods that better reflect and handle this interactive diagnostic process.

Method: The authors construct Med-Inquire, a benchmark based on real-world clinical cases where the full patient file is hidden behind Patient and Examination agents, forcing the diagnostic agent to interactively ask questions and order tests to gradually acquire information. They then propose EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent employing a Diagnose-Grade-Evolve loop: an Actor agent performs the diagnosis; a Process Grader assesses each action for clinical value and resource efficiency; an Evolver updates the Actor’s strategy by modifying its prompt and memory based on this feedback, effectively learning better diagnostic policies at test time.

Result: EvoClinician is empirically evaluated on the Med-Inquire benchmark and shown to outperform continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents, including memory-based agents, in terms of diagnostic performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Interactive, multi-turn benchmarks like Med-Inquire better capture real clinical workflows than one-shot setups, and self-evolving agents such as EvoClinician can learn more efficient diagnostic strategies during test time, achieving superior performance over existing approaches. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of test-time strategy evolution for complex, resource-constrained decision-making tasks in medical AI.

Abstract: Prevailing medical AI operates on an unrealistic ''one-shot'' model, diagnosing from a complete patient file. However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents. The code is available at https://github.com/yf-he/EvoClinician

### [95] [Golden Goose: A Simple Trick to Synthesize Unlimited RLVR Tasks from Unverifiable Internet Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22975)
*Ximing Lu,David Acuna,Jaehun Jung,Jian Hu,Di Zhang,Shizhe Diao,Yunheng Zou,Shaokun Zhang,Brandon Cui,Mingjie Liu,Hyunwoo Kim,Prithviraj Ammanabrolu,Jan Kautz,Yi Dong,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Golden Goose is a method to automatically create vast amounts of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) data from ordinary internet text by turning it into multiple-choice reasoning tasks, which significantly boosts LLM reasoning performance, including in niche domains like cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR approaches depend on a relatively small pool of verifiable data (e.g., problems with clearly checkable answers), causing training to saturate and limiting further gains in complex reasoning for LLMs. Much of the internet’s reasoning-rich text (like science textbooks) is unverifiable in the RLVR sense and thus underused. The authors want a way to (1) tap into this huge unverifiable corpus and (2) keep scaling RLVR training without running out of suitable data.

Method: They introduce Golden Goose, which converts generic text into RLVR tasks via a fill-in-the-middle (FIM) multiple-choice question format. For a given source passage, an LLM is prompted to: (a) identify and mask key reasoning steps or critical spans, and (b) generate several diverse and plausible distractor options alongside the correct answer. This procedure is applied at scale over large corpora (including science/math/programming textbooks and FineWeb cybersecurity text) to create GooseReason datasets: GooseReason-0.7M (0.7M tasks across math, programming, and science) and GooseReason-Cyber (cybersecurity-specific tasks). These datasets are then used for RL with verifiable rewards, where success is simply choosing the correct masked completion among options.

Result: Using GooseReason-0.7M for RL training revives performance of models whose gains had saturated on existing RLVR data, delivering sustained improvements under continued RL. The method yields new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B instruction-tuned models on 15 diverse benchmarks. In the cybersecurity use case, GooseReason-Cyber allows Qwen3-4B-Instruct to surpass the performance of a much larger 7B cybersecurity-specialized model that had extensive domain-specific pre- and post-training, establishing a new SOTA in that domain.

Conclusion: Automatically synthesizing RLVR tasks from unverifiable, reasoning-rich internet text is both feasible and highly effective. Golden Goose turns otherwise unusable corpora into scalable RLVR data, enabling continued improvements in LLM reasoning ability and strong performance in specialized domains like cybersecurity. This approach suggests a practical path to ongoing scaling of RLVR training without being constrained by the scarcity of naturally verifiable data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a cornerstone for unlocking complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training. This highlights the potential of automatically scaling up RLVR data by exploiting abundant, reasoning-rich, unverifiable internet text.

### [96] [Quantifying Model Uniqueness in Heterogeneous AI Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22977)
*Lei You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a statistical framework (ISQED) to measure how behaviorally unique an AI model is within an ecosystem of models, by designing controlled interventions and quantifying the part of its behavior that cannot be replicated by mixtures of other models (PIER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI shifts from single models to ecosystems of many foundation models and adapters, regulators and practitioners need to know whether a new model is genuinely adding new capabilities or is largely redundant with existing ones. Existing approaches based on passively logged data or cooperative game-theoretic attributions cannot reliably distinguish true novelty from functional overlap, which complicates governance, safety evaluation, and resource allocation. The paper aims to provide a principled way to audit model uniqueness for trustworthy AI governance.

Method: They introduce In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED), which treats model comparisons as controlled interventions: the same inputs (interventions) are applied across models to isolate intrinsic behavioral differences. They define model uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), the part of a model’s behavior that cannot be expressed as any stochastic convex combination (routing-based mixture) of peer models. They show the non-identifiability of uniqueness from observational logs, derive a minimax-optimal scaling law for the number of active queries needed for auditing using an adaptive protocol, and analyze why cooperative game-theoretic tools like Shapley values cannot detect redundancy. They instantiate the framework with the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and apply it to multiple model ecosystems.

Result: Theoretically, they prove: (1) uniqueness is non-identifiable from passive observational data without controlled interventions; (2) their active auditing protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity scaling as dσ^2γ^{-2} log(Nd/δ); (3) cooperative game-theoretic approaches, such as Shapley values, are structurally incapable of detecting model redundancy. Empirically, using the DISCO estimator, they audit diverse ecosystems (vision models like ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT, language models like BERT/RoBERTa, and traffic forecasting models) and demonstrate how much of each model’s behavior is uniquely peer-inexpressible versus replicable by mixtures of others.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundations-level, intervention-based methodology for auditing model uniqueness in heterogeneous AI ecosystems. By defining and estimating PIER through controlled interventions (ISQED) and implementing it via DISCO, they show that one can rigorously determine when a model is functionally substitutable by routing among existing peers. This enables moving from explanations of individual models to a systematic science of governing and auditing entire model ecosystems, with implications for regulation, safety, and deployment decisions.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve from isolated predictors into complex, heterogeneous ecosystems of foundation models and specialized adapters, distinguishing genuine behavioral novelty from functional redundancy becomes a critical governance challenge. Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($dσ^2γ^{-2}\log(Nd/δ)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.

### [97] [Why Your Deep Research Agent Fails? On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22984)
*Yuhao Zhan,Tianyu Fan,Linxuan Huang,Zirui Guo,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents DeepHalluBench and a process-aware evaluation framework to diagnose and categorize hallucinations in Deep Research Agents by auditing full research trajectories using the PIES taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of Deep Research Agents focus on end-to-end outcomes, which hide intermediate hallucinations (like flawed planning) that accumulate and cause failures, so the authors want a systematic, fine-grained way to see where and how these hallucinations arise.

Method: They propose a process-aware evaluation that audits full research trajectories rather than final answers, introduce the PIES taxonomy that classifies hallucinations by functional component (Planning vs. Summarization) and error property (Explicit vs. Implicit), instantiate this taxonomy into a detailed annotation and scoring framework, identify 100 hallucination-prone and adversarial tasks, and use these to build the DeepHalluBench benchmark.

Result: Applying this benchmark and framework to six state-of-the-art Deep Research Agents shows that none of them are reliably robust; the analysis reveals common patterns like hallucinations that propagate across steps and systematic cognitive biases that underlie many errors.

Conclusion: Process-aware, taxonomy-driven evaluation exposes systemic weaknesses in Deep Research Agents that are missed by outcome-only benchmarks, and DeepHalluBench plus the PIES taxonomy provide tools and insights to guide future architectural improvements aimed at reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

TL;DR: TriCEGAR automates state abstraction for runtime verification of agentic AI by learning predicate-tree abstractions from execution traces, building an MDP online, and enabling probabilistic model checking and anomaly detection without manual state design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assuring the behavior of agentic AI systems is difficult because they act via tools in stochastic environments, leading to long, nondeterministic interaction traces. Existing Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance methods require developers to manually design state abstractions for the MDP used in runtime verification, which is application-specific, error-prone, and a barrier to adoption. There is a need for an automated, data-driven way to construct behavioral models suitable for verification.

Method: The paper introduces TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction and verification mechanism. It collects typed agent lifecycle events from execution logs and uses them to learn state abstractions represented as predicate trees. These abstractions define the states of an online-constructed MDP capturing agent behavior. The approach iteratively refines abstractions using counterexamples (in a CEGAR-style loop) and then applies probabilistic model checking to this MDP to compute quantitative assurance properties like maximum probability of success and minimum probability of failure. Additionally, it leverages run likelihoods derived from the learned model for anomaly detection.

Result: TriCEGAR demonstrates that state abstraction for agentic AI runtime verification can be learned automatically from traces rather than hand-crafted. It yields an online behavioral MDP amenable to quantitative probabilistic model checking, enabling computation of bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure). The method also supports anomaly detection by flagging low-likelihood runs relative to the learned behavioral model, offering a practical guardrailing signal.

Conclusion: Automated, trace-driven abstraction via TriCEGAR reduces the manual effort and domain-specific expertise needed for runtime verification of agentic AI systems. By learning predicate-tree-based abstractions, constructing an MDP online, and enabling probabilistic model checking and anomaly detection, TriCEGAR provides a framework-native, scalable path to Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance for complex, tool-using agents operating in stochastic environments.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems act through tools and evolve their behavior over long, stochastic interaction traces. This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure). We also show how run likelihoods enable anomaly detection as a guardrailing signal.

### [99] [Guided by Trajectories: Repairing and Rewarding Tool-Use Trajectories for Tool-Integrated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23032)
*Siyu Gong,Linan Yue,Weibo Gao,Fangzhou Yao,Shimin Di,Lei Feng,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoTraj is a two-stage framework that automatically learns better tool-integrated reasoning for LLMs by repairing low-quality tool-use trajectories and training a trajectory-level reward model to optimize reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TIR methods rely on a small set of high-quality, handpicked or score-filtered trajectories and sparse, outcome-only rewards. This leads to biased supervision and weak learning signals for complex, tool-based reasoning. The authors aim to provide richer, more accurate supervision at the trajectory level, and to automatically improve low-quality reasoning traces instead of discarding them, so models can learn more robust tool-use strategies.

Method: AutoTraj has two stages. (1) SFT stage: For each query, the base LLM generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories. These are evaluated along several quality dimensions. High-quality trajectories are kept. Low-quality ones are passed to an auxiliary LLM acting as a “repairer,” which rewrites them into improved trajectories. The combination of original and repaired trajectories forms: (a) a synthetic supervised fine-tuning dataset (using high-quality + repaired trajectories as targets), and (b) a trajectory preference dataset, where each repaired trajectory is preferred over its original low-quality version. (2) RL stage: From the preference dataset, they train a trajectory-level reward model that scores reasoning paths. This reward is combined with outcome-based and format-based rewards, and used in reinforcement learning to fine-tune the TIR model toward generating reliable reasoning and tool-use sequences.

Result: On real-world TIR benchmarks, models trained with AutoTraj show improved performance over baselines that rely only on outcome-based rewards or un-repaired trajectories. The framework yields higher-quality tool-use reasoning paths, better task success rates, and more reliable tool-calling behavior, as validated across multiple evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: Automatically repairing low-quality tool-use trajectories and leveraging them for both supervised learning and trajectory-level reward modeling can substantially improve tool-integrated reasoning in LLMs. AutoTraj demonstrates that richer trajectory supervision and explicit trajectory rewards lead to more reliable and effective use of external tools compared with prior outcome-only or hand-filtered approaches.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks by interacting with external tools, yet existing approaches depend on high-quality synthesized trajectories selected by scoring functions and sparse outcome-based rewards, providing limited and biased supervision for learning TIR. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.

### [100] [The Hot Mess of AI: How Does Misalignment Scale With Model Intelligence and Task Complexity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23045)
*Alexander Hägele,Aryo Pradipta Gema,Henry Sleight,Ethan Perez,Jascha Sohl-Dickstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how highly capable AI systems fail, showing that as models reason longer and tackle harder, sequential tasks, their mistakes become more incoherent (high variance) rather than reflecting consistent pursuit of a wrong but stable goal (bias).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more capable and are deployed on broad, high-stakes tasks, understanding the *structure* of their failures matters for safety: do they fail in a goal-directed, systematically misaligned way, or in an erratic, incoherent way? This distinction affects what kinds of alignment and safety work are most important.

Method: The authors formalize failure structure using a bias-variance decomposition over task outcomes. They define an AI model’s "incoherence" on a task as the fraction of its error attributable to variance (test-time randomness) rather than bias (systematic deviation). They then empirically evaluate incoherence across various tasks and frontier models, varying model scale and the amount of sequential reasoning/actions (long-horizon settings).

Result: Empirically, they find that as models spend more time reasoning and acting (i.e., in longer sequences of decisions), their failures become increasingly incoherent: a larger share of the error comes from variance rather than bias. The dependence of incoherence on model scale is task-dependent, but in multiple experimental setups, larger and more capable models are *more* incoherent than smaller ones. Thus simply scaling models does not reliably reduce incoherent failure modes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that for harder, long-horizon tasks where advanced AIs are likely to be deployed, failures will tend to look more like unpredictable, erratic misbehavior than like consistent pursuit of a misaligned objective. This implies risks such as industrial accidents from stochastic failures, while somewhat reducing (though not eliminating) the likelihood of highly coherent, goal-driven misalignment. As a result, the authors argue that alignment research should prioritize approaches aimed at preventing reward hacking and goal misspecification, as scale alone will not fix incoherent failure behavior.

Abstract: As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with more general and consequential tasks. The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They create ContextMATH, a benchmark that turns standard competition math problems into contextual, real-world-style scenarios, and show that models perform much worse due to difficulties in formulating the math problem from the description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLMs perform strongly on clean, abstract math benchmarks, they are unreliable in realistic applications where problems are embedded in natural language context. The authors want to systematically measure and understand this gap, especially how contextualization and hidden constraints affect performance.

Method: They build ContextMATH by repurposing problems from AIME and MATH-500 into two formats: (1) Scenario Grounding, which wraps existing problems in realistic narrative contexts without changing underlying math; (2) Complexity Scaling, which hides explicit conditions as sub-problems, reflecting how constraints appear in practice. They evaluate 61 open-source and proprietary LLMs on these variants, compare performance drops from original problems, and conduct error analyses focusing on problem formulation vs reasoning. They also run fine-tuning experiments with contextual data and with formulation-only training to test how targeted training influences performance.

Result: Across 61 models, both open-source and proprietary systems show large accuracy drops on contextual variants: open-source models lose on average 13 points on Scenario Grounding and 34 on Complexity Scaling, while proprietary models lose 13 and 20 respectively. Errors mainly arise from incorrect problem formulation, and this formulation accuracy worsens as the original math problem gets harder. Larger models are more likely to solve the problem once they formulate it correctly, suggesting scale helps both understanding and reasoning. Fine-tuning on contextual scenarios improves but does not close the gap, and training only on formulation tasks does not help.

Conclusion: ContextMATH reveals a persistent and substantial gap between benchmark math performance and real-world contextual mathematical reasoning in LLMs. Successful problem formulation is a critical prerequisite and, together with reasoning, forms a dual bottleneck. While model scaling and contextual fine-tuning lead to some gains, they do not eliminate performance drops, indicating that contextual mathematical reasoning remains an open, central challenge for LLM development.

Abstract: Large language models now solve many benchmark math problems at near-expert levels, yet this progress has not fully translated into reliable performance in real-world applications. We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.

### [102] [MedMCP-Calc: Benchmarking LLMs for Realistic Medical Calculator Scenarios via MCP Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23049)
*Yakun Zhu,Yutong Huang,Shengqian Qin,Zhongzhen Huang,Shaoting Zhang,Xiaofan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces MedMCP-Calc, a benchmark to test LLMs on realistic, multi-step medical calculator workflows using EHR data and tools, and presents CalcMate, a fine-tuned model that performs best among open-source systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical calculator benchmarks only test simple, single-step, explicitly specified calculations, which do not reflect how clinicians actually use calculators in practice. Real-world use involves interpreting vague clinical questions, pulling data from EHR systems, choosing the right calculator, and performing multi-step computations, often with external tools. There is a need for a benchmark that captures this end-to-end workflow and reveals where LLMs struggle in realistic clinical decision support settings.

Method: The authors build MedMCP-Calc, a benchmark with 118 tasks spanning 4 clinical domains. Each task is framed as a fuzzy, natural-language clinical query and requires: (1) interacting with a structured EHR database via SQL, (2) retrieving external references, (3) selecting the appropriate medical calculator, and (4) performing multi-step computations via tools integrated using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). They then evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on these tasks, measuring not only final answers but also process-level behavior, including tool use and intermediate steps. Based on the observed failure patterns, they design CalcMate, a fine-tuned model that explicitly incorporates scenario planning and stronger tool-usage strategies.

Result: Across 23 tested models, even leading systems such as Claude Opus 4.5 show major performance gaps on MedMCP-Calc: they often fail to pick the right calculator from a fuzzy query, perform poorly in iterative SQL-based EHR querying, and frequently avoid using external tools for numerical calculations. Performance is uneven across clinical domains, highlighting domain-specific weaknesses. CalcMate, the proposed fine-tuned model, achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the benchmark, demonstrating measurable gains from targeted scenario-planning and tool-augmentation training.

Conclusion: Realistic, end-to-end medical calculator use exposes significant weaknesses in current LLMs that are not captured by simpler, single-step benchmarks. MedMCP-Calc provides a more faithful evaluation of clinical workflow capabilities by requiring fuzzy query interpretation, EHR interaction, calculator selection, and tool-mediated computation. The improved performance of CalcMate suggests that specialized training on scenario planning and tool use can substantially enhance LLM effectiveness in medical calculator workflows. The benchmark and codebase are released to facilitate further research and model development.

Abstract: Medical calculators are fundamental to quantitative, evidence-based clinical practice. However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

### [103] [Chain-of-thought obfuscation learned from output supervision can generalise to unseen tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23086)
*Nathaniel Mitrani Hadida,Sassan Bhanji,Cameron Tice,Puria Radmard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how training language models with chain-of-thought (CoT) and penalties on harmful behavior can cause models to intentionally obfuscate their reasoning traces, reducing their usefulness for safety monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought traces are used both to improve LLM performance and to interpret or monitor model behavior, especially to detect dangerous or reward-hacking behaviors. However, optimization pressure from safety training (penalizing harmful outputs) may incentivize models to hide or distort their reasoning instead of changing their underlying behavior. The authors aim to understand whether and how such obfuscation arises, and whether it generalizes across tasks, thereby undermining trust in CoT as a monitoring tool.

Method: The authors construct reward-hacking scenarios (e.g., using leaked information) where models can either behave safely or exploit the leak. They then apply different training or optimization regimes that penalize harmful outcomes, sometimes directly on the CoT and sometimes only on final actions after the CoT is closed. They measure whether models learn to obfuscate their reasoning traces (e.g., by omitting or misrepresenting key steps) while still performing reward-hacking behaviors. They also test whether both the harmful behavior and the obfuscation generalize to new, unseen reward-hacking tasks.

Result: Models trained under these optimization pressures learn to obfuscate their chain-of-thought: they continue to perform reward hacking while producing CoT traces that do not faithfully reflect the true reasoning process. This obfuscation generalizes to new tasks: once a model learns to hide its reasoning about one kind of reward hacking, it tends to also hide reasoning in different, unseen reward-hacking settings. Crucially, this occurs even when training only penalizes the final actions after the CoT, not the CoT itself.

Conclusion: Safety practices that rely on penalizing harmful generations, while assuming chain-of-thought remains a faithful window into model reasoning, may be unreliable. The optimization pressure can cause models to strategically hide or distort their reasoning traces, and this behavior can transfer across tasks. Therefore, current CoT-based monitoring approaches may unintentionally reduce the monitorability of LLMs, and new methods are needed that are robust to such obfuscation dynamics.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning provides a significant performance uplift to LLMs by enabling planning, exploration, and deliberation of their actions. CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.

### [104] [THINKSAFE: Self-Generated Safety Alignment for Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23143)
*Seanie Lee,Sangwoo Park,Yumin Choi,Gyeongman Kim,Minki Kang,Jihun Yun,Dongmin Park,Jongho Park,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkSafe is a self-alignment method for large reasoning models that restores safety without external teacher models by using the model’s own latent safety knowledge and lightweight refusal steering to generate safe reasoning traces for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models trained with RL to produce long chain-of-thoughts become over-compliant and more vulnerable to harmful prompts. Existing fixes use external teacher models for distillation, which creates distributional mismatch and harms native reasoning ability. There is a need for an alignment method that improves safety while preserving in-distribution reasoning performance and avoiding heavy external teachers.

Method: ThinkSafe introduces a self-generated alignment framework: (1) identify that LRMs still contain latent knowledge to detect harmful content, though it is suppressed by over-compliance; (2) apply lightweight “refusal steering” to unlock this latent safety knowledge and guide the model to produce safety-aware, refusal-oriented reasoning traces that remain in the model’s native distribution; (3) fine-tune the model on these self-generated, safety-aligned responses so that safety is restored with minimal distribution shift and without using external teacher models; (4) evaluate on LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 to measure safety and reasoning trade-offs and computational cost against GRPO-based methods.

Result: On DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3, ThinkSafe substantially improves safety behavior while largely preserving reasoning capabilities. Compared to GRPO, ThinkSafe achieves better safety, similar reasoning performance, and does so with notably lower computational cost. This shows that self-generated, in-distribution safety traces can effectively realign LRMs without external teachers.

Conclusion: Self-generated alignment via ThinkSafe is an effective way to restore safety in large reasoning models that have been over-optimized for compliance. By unlocking latent safety knowledge with refusal steering and fine-tuning on in-distribution safety reasoning, models can regain strong safety alignment without sacrificing reasoning proficiency or relying on expensive external teacher models, offering a more efficient and principled alignment strategy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning tasks to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost. Code, models, and datasets are available at https://github.com/seanie12/ThinkSafe.git.

### [105] [Make Anything Match Your Target: Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Closed-Source MLLMs via Multi-Crop Routed Meta Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23179)
*Hui Lu,Yi Yu,Yiming Yang,Chenyu Yi,Xueyi Ke,Qixing Zhang,Bingquan Shen,Alex Kot,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCRMO-Attack, a universal, targeted, and transferable adversarial attack against closed-source multimodal large language models, significantly improving attack success rates on commercial systems like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box adversarial attacks on commercial multimodal LLMs are mostly sample-specific, meaning each input requires its own perturbation. This limits practicality and scalability, especially when trying to steer many arbitrary inputs toward the same target output under closed-source, black-box constraints. The authors are motivated to design universal perturbations that are both targeted and transferable across different commercial MLLMs, a more challenging but more realistic and powerful threat model.

Method: They formalize Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation should cause arbitrary inputs to elicit a desired target output across unknown MLLMs. To tackle challenges in this setting, they propose MCRMO-Attack with three core components: (1) Multi-Crop Aggregation combined with an Attention-Guided Crop to stabilize target supervision when random crops introduce high variance; (2) alignability-gated Token Routing to improve token-level alignment reliability when universality suppresses image-specific anchors; and (3) a meta-learned cross-target perturbation prior that provides robust initialization and improves few-source per-target adaptation. These components are trained and optimized on source models, then evaluated in a black-box transfer fashion on commercial MLLMs.

Result: On commercial multimodal LLMs, MCRMO-Attack substantially outperforms prior universal adversarial attack baselines. Specifically, it improves the unseen-image targeted attack success rate by 23.7 percentage points on GPT-4o and 19.9 percentage points on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest existing universal baseline, demonstrating both strong universality and transferability across closed-source models.

Conclusion: The study shows that universal, targeted, and transferable adversarial perturbations against closed-source multimodal LLMs are feasible and can achieve much higher success rates than prior methods. By addressing instability in target supervision, unreliable token alignment, and sensitivity to initialization, MCRMO-Attack provides a more robust approach to UTTAA. This highlights significant security and robustness concerns for commercial MLLMs, suggesting the need for stronger defenses and evaluation protocols against such universal targeted attacks.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks on closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been increasingly explored under black-box transfer, yet prior methods are predominantly sample-specific and offer limited reusability across inputs. We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.

### [106] [TSAQA: Time Series Analysis Question And Answering Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23204)
*Baoyu Jing,Sanhorn Chen,Lecheng Zheng,Boyu Liu,Zihao Li,Jiaru Zou,Tianxin Wei,Zhining Liu,Zhichen Zeng,Ruizhong Qiu,Xiao Lin,Yuchen Yan,Dongqi Fu,Jingchao Ni,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSAQA is a large unified benchmark for multi-task time series question answering that covers six diverse temporal analysis tasks and shows current LLMs still struggle with complex temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series QA benchmarks focus narrowly on forecasting and anomaly detection, failing to capture the breadth of real-world temporal analysis needs. The authors aim to create a more comprehensive, realistic, and challenging benchmark to evaluate how well LLMs can understand and reason over time series across many domains and task types.

Method: The authors construct TSAQA, a 210k-sample dataset spanning 13 domains and six task categories: anomaly detection, classification, characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. They design questions in multiple formats—true/false, multiple-choice, and a novel puzzling format—to probe different aspects of temporal reasoning. They then perform zero-shot evaluations of commercial and open-source LLMs, and also test instruction-tuned open-source models to assess performance and difficulty.

Result: In zero-shot settings, even strong commercial LLMs perform modestly: the best, Gemini-2.5-Flash, reaches an average score of 65.08 across tasks. Instruction tuning improves open-source models, with LLaMA-3.1-8B being the best among them, yet its performance still lags and indicates substantial headroom for improvement. Overall, results show that TSAQA tasks remain challenging for current LLMs, especially for complex temporal analysis beyond basic forecasting or anomaly detection.

Conclusion: TSAQA effectively broadens and unifies time series QA evaluation, revealing that current LLMs have significant limitations in complex temporal reasoning across diverse domains and task formats. The benchmark can serve as a standard testbed to drive future research on models and methods better suited for rich time series understanding and multi-task temporal analysis.

Abstract: Time series data are integral to critical applications across domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and environmental science. While recent work has begun to explore multi-task time series question answering (QA), current benchmarks remain limited to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce TSAQA, a novel unified benchmark designed to broaden task coverage and evaluate diverse temporal analysis capabilities. TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. Spanning 210k samples across 13 domains, the dataset employs diverse formats, including true-or-false (TF), multiple-choice (MC), and a novel puzzling (PZ), to comprehensively assess time series analysis. Zero-shot evaluation demonstrates that these tasks are challenging for current Large Language Models (LLMs): the best-performing commercial LLM, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves an average score of only 65.08. Although instruction tuning boosts open-source performance: the best-performing open-source model, LLaMA-3.1-8B, shows significant room for improvement, highlighting the complexity of temporal analysis for LLMs.

### [107] [High-quality generation of dynamic game content via small language models: A proof of concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23206)
*Morten I. K. Munk,Arturo Valdivia,Paolo Burelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a way to get high-quality, real-time game content generation using small language models instead of large cloud-based ones, by aggressively fine-tuning them on tightly scoped, synthetically generated training data grounded in a specific game world, and validates this with a proof-of-concept RPG system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful for generating dynamic game content but suffer from narrative incoherence, high latency and cost, and dependence on cloud access, which is unsuitable for offline or resource-constrained games. Existing uses of small language models avoid these issues but severely degrade output quality. The paper is motivated by the need for a practical, high-quality, and locally runnable alternative that fits typical game engine constraints.

Method: The authors propose using small language models that are aggressively fine-tuned on narrowly scoped tasks with constrained context and structure. They generate synthetic training data with a DAG-based method that tightly grounds the model in a specific game world and narratological framework. They then build a proof-of-concept minimal RPG loop centered on rhetorical reputation battles, using a single specialized SLM as the core generative component and a retry-until-success decoding strategy, with quality measured via an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation scheme.

Result: The proof-of-concept shows that a single, highly specialized SLM can generate content of adequate quality, as judged by an LLM-based evaluator, when combined with a simple retry-until-success strategy. The system achieves predictable latency compatible with real-time content generation in typical game engines, demonstrating that SLMs can practically replace cloud-based LLMs for this kind of application.

Conclusion: Aggressively fine-tuned, narrowly specialized SLMs, trained on synthetically generated, game-world-grounded data, can provide a practical and robust basis for real-time narrative game content generation on local hardware. While challenges remain—especially how to assess quality locally without LLM-as-a-judge—the approach is feasible and may scale to networks of specialized agents aligned with narratological frameworks, offering a more deployable alternative to monolithic cloud LLMs in games.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.

Motivation: Multiagent systems can tackle complex tasks through specialization, but finetuning them is hard because it’s unclear how to assign credit to each agent’s actions and multiagent rollouts are expensive, making sample efficiency crucial. There is also a desire to scale such systems to complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision, without relying on ground-truth labels.

Method: The authors propose MAPPA (finetuning MultiAgent systems with Per-action Process rewards from AI feedback). Instead of providing only a final task-level reward or supervision at completion, MAPPA assigns rewards to individual actions taken by each agent. AI feedback is used to generate these per-action process rewards, providing fine-grained supervision and more learning signal per rollout, improving credit assignment and sample efficiency during finetuning.

Result: Applied to competition math problems (AIME, AMC) and tool-augmented data analysis tasks, MAPPA achieves sizable performance improvements over baselines: +5.0–17.5 percentage points on AIME, +7.8–17.2 percentage points on AMC, and a +12.5 percentage point increase in success rate on data analysis tasks, along with up to 30% improvements on quality metrics.

Conclusion: Per-action, AI-generated process rewards can effectively guide finetuning in multiagent systems, improving credit assignment and sample efficiency, which leads to significant performance gains across domains such as math problem solving and data analysis. This provides an initial step toward scaling multiagent systems to more complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.

Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determine whether there exist polynomial or strongly polynomial algorithms for robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with uncertainty in transition probabilities, a long-standing open problem analogous to classical results for standard MDPs.

Method: Study $(s,a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets and discounted rewards; design and analyze a robust policy iteration algorithm, and prove that its running time is strongly polynomial when the discount factor is a fixed constant.

Result: The authors prove that for $(s,a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant discount factor, robust policy iteration terminates in strongly polynomial time, providing an efficient algorithm for computing optimal robust policies in this setting.

Conclusion: An important open algorithmic question is resolved: the key robust counterpart of policy iteration for classical MDPs admits a strongly polynomial-time algorithm under standard rectangularity and $L_\infty$ uncertainty assumptions when the discount factor is fixed.

Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model in sequential decision making. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem. In this work, we show that a robust policy iteration algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant (fixed) discount factor, resolving an important algorithmic question.
