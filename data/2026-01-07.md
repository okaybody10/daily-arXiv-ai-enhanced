*Zhaojiang Lin,Yong Xu,Kai Sun,Jing Zheng,Yin Huang,Surya Teja Appini,Krish Narang,Renjie Tao,Ishan Kapil Jain,Siddhant Arora,Ruizhi Li,Yiteng Huang,Kaushik Patnaik,Wenfang Xu,Suwon Shon,Yue Liu,Ahmed A Aly,Anuj Kumar,Florian Metze,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces WearVox, a benchmark for evaluating voice assistants on realistic, egocentric, multi-channel audio from wearable AI glasses across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voice assistant benchmarks mostly use clean, generic conversational audio and fail to capture the unique challenges of wearable, always-on assistants, such as noisy and dynamic egocentric audio, rapid micro-interactions, and the need to distinguish user commands from background speech. There is a need for a realistic, systematic benchmark to evaluate and improve speech LLMs under these wearable-specific conditions.

Method: The authors build WearVox, a dataset of 3,842 multi-channel audio recordings collected via AI glasses in realistic indoor and outdoor settings. The recordings cover five tasks relevant to wearable assistants: Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation. Each example includes rich metadata for fine-grained analysis. They then benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech LLMs on these tasks and run a case study comparing single-channel vs multi-channel SLLMs to evaluate the value of spatial audio cues.

Result: State-of-the-art real-time speech LLMs achieve only 29%–59% accuracy on the WearVox benchmark, with notable drops in performance for noisy outdoor audio, demonstrating that the tasks and conditions are challenging and realistic. The case study shows that SLLMs using multi-channel audio perform more robustly under environmental noise and are better at distinguishing device-directed speech from background conversations than single-channel counterparts.

Conclusion: WearVox provides a challenging, realistic benchmark for wearable voice assistants and shows that current SLLMs struggle in these conditions, particularly in noisy outdoor environments. Multi-channel, spatial audio input is shown to be crucial for robust performance, especially for differentiating user commands from background speech. The benchmark is positioned as a comprehensive testbed to drive future research and development in context-aware, wearable voice AI.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as AI glasses are transforming voice assistants into always-available, hands-free collaborators that integrate seamlessly with daily life, but they also introduce challenges like egocentric audio affected by motion and noise, rapid micro-interactions, and the need to distinguish device-directed speech from background conversations. Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.

### [2] [PCEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Physical Computing Capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02404)
*Inpyo Song,Eunji Jeon,Jangwon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces PCEval, the first automatic benchmark to evaluate LLMs on physical computing tasks (circuits + code + breadboard layout) and shows models struggle with physical layout despite good code and logical design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used in software development, but their capabilities are underexplored when software must obey hardware constraints in physical computing contexts. Existing benchmarks focus on pure software or logic and generally require human evaluation, lacking a standardized, reproducible way to test how well LLMs handle hardware-aware tasks such as circuit design and physical layout. The authors aim to fill this evaluation gap.

Method: The authors design PCEval, a benchmark and simulation-based framework that automatically evaluates LLMs on physical computing projects at multiple difficulty levels. Tasks require models to (1) generate electronic circuits, (2) produce compatible code, and (3) create physically realizable breadboard layouts. The framework validates outputs programmatically within a simulation environment, checking both logical correctness and adherence to hardware implementation constraints like pin connections and error-free circuits. They run 13 state-of-the-art LLMs through these tasks to compare performance.

Result: Across 13 leading LLMs, the benchmark shows strong performance on code generation and logical circuit design but notably poor performance on physical breadboard layout tasks. Errors commonly involve incorrect or inconsistent pin connections, invalid wiring, and circuit configurations that would not work in practice, indicating a large gap between abstract reasoning and detailed physical implementation reasoning.

Conclusion: PCEval demonstrates that current LLMs, while capable in software and high-level circuit reasoning, are weak at translating these designs into correct, physically implementable layouts. The benchmark offers the first fully automatic, reproducible measure of this capability, providing a baseline for future models and tools. The authors argue that PCEval can drive progress in AI systems for hardware-dependent computing and serve as a foundation for better support tools and educational resources in physical computing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, including software development, education, and technical assistance. Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{PCEval} (Physical Computing Evaluation), the first benchmark in physical computing that enables a fully automatic evaluation of the capabilities of LLM in both the logical and physical aspects of the projects, without requiring human assessment. Our evaluation framework assesses LLMs in generating circuits and producing compatible code across varying levels of project complexity. Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.

### [3] [Losses that Cook: Topological Optimal Transport for Structured Recipe Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02531)
*Mattia Ottoborgo,Daniele Rege Cambrin,Paolo Garza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They improve recipe generation by adding new training losses that focus on ingredient sets and cooking constraints, leading to better ingredient and action accuracy and higher human preference than standard cross-entropy training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard recipe generation models are trained mainly with cross-entropy, which optimizes text fluency but not domain-specific requirements like correct ingredients, coherent actions, and accurate timing/temperature. The authors want to better align training objectives with what actually matters in cooking recipes, going beyond generic language modeling metrics.

Method: Starting from the RECIPE-NLG framework, they introduce composite training objectives that augment or modify cross-entropy. A key contribution is a new topological loss: ingredient lists are mapped to embeddings and treated as point clouds, and the model is trained to minimize the divergence between the predicted ingredient cloud and the gold-standard ingredient cloud. They also explore Dice loss and mixed (combined) losses. Performance is evaluated with both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics (ingredient, actions, time, temperature).

Result: The topological ingredient loss clearly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics compared with standard cross-entropy. Dice loss is particularly effective for improving the precision of time and temperature predictions. A mixed loss function that combines objectives achieves a good balance, with synergistic gains on ingredient quantity and cooking time. Across automatic metrics and human evaluation, the proposed objectives outperform baselines.

Conclusion: Optimizing recipe generation requires domain-aware training objectives rather than relying only on cross-entropy. Representing ingredients as point clouds in embedding space and introducing a topological loss leads to better ingredient and action accuracy, while Dice and mixed losses strengthen time and temperature control. These composite objectives produce recipes that are preferred by human judges in the majority of cases, validating the usefulness of the proposed losses for structured, constraint-rich NLG tasks.

Abstract: Cooking recipes are complex procedures that require not only a fluent and factual text, but also accurate timing, temperature, and procedural coherence, as well as the correct composition of ingredients. Standard training procedures are primarily based on cross-entropy and focus solely on fluency. Building on RECIPE-NLG, we investigate the use of several composite objectives and present a new topological loss that represents ingredient lists as point clouds in embedding space, minimizing the divergence between predicted and gold ingredients. Using both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics, we find that our loss significantly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics. Meanwhile, the Dice loss excels in time/temperature precision, and the mixed loss yields competitive trade-offs with synergistic gains in quantity and time. A human preference analysis supports our finding, showing our model is preferred in 62% of the cases.

### [4] [ModeX: Evaluator-Free Best-of-N Selection for Open-Ended Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02535)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free framework to pick the best output from multiple LLM generations by finding the dominant semantic mode via clustering, improving open-ended generation quality efficiently across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In open-ended tasks with no single correct answer, LLMs produce multiple diverse outputs, but reliably selecting one high-quality output is difficult. Existing Best-of-N and self-consistency methods either depend on external evaluators or simple string-match voting, which do not generalize well to open-ended text and can be computationally expensive or impractical. The authors aim to design a selection method that can exploit multiple generations to improve robustness and quality without needing extra models or rigid voting schemes.

Method: The authors propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), which treats multiple candidate generations as points in a semantic space and identifies the modal output that represents the dominant consensus. ModeX builds a similarity graph over generated texts, then recursively applies spectral clustering to partition candidates and select a centroid that best represents the largest, most coherent cluster. This process does not require external reward models or additional inference. They also propose ModeX-Lite, a more efficient variant that uses early pruning to reduce computation while preserving the core selection principle.

Result: In experiments across several open-ended tasks, including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, ModeX and ModeX-Lite consistently outperform single-sample baselines and standard multi-path methods like naive Best-of-N or basic self-consistency. The methods achieve higher quality and more robust outputs from the same set of candidate generations, with ModeX-Lite offering improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: ModeX provides a general, evaluator-free framework for selecting high-quality outputs from multiple LLM generations by identifying the semantic mode among candidates. It extends majority voting to open-ended text via similarity-based clustering and works across diverse tasks without auxiliary models. ModeX and ModeX-Lite offer a practical, computationally efficient way to make open-ended LLM generation more robust and reliable, as demonstrated empirically on summarization, code, and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Selecting a single high-quality output from multiple stochastic generations remains a fundamental challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in open-ended tasks where no canonical answer exists. While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX--Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks--including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning--our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/ModeX.

### [5] [Fact-Checking with Large Language Models via Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02574)
*Haoran Wang,Maryam Khalid,Qiong Wu,Jian Gao,Cheng Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose PCC, a confidence-estimation framework that combines probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency to dynamically decide when an LLM should answer from its own knowledge, retrieve evidence, or perform deeper search, improving factuality and efficiency over prior fact-checking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are used in settings where factual accuracy is important but they frequently hallucinate. Existing fact-checking approaches rely heavily on indiscriminate external retrieval, ignoring what the model already knows and introducing noise. They also lack mechanisms to focus retrieval on specific points of uncertainty in the model’s reasoning. The authors aim to more human-like fact-checking: leveraging internal knowledge when appropriate and selectively using external information when confidence is low.

Method: They define a framework called Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC) that estimates an LLM’s factual confidence by combining two signals: (1) probabilistic certainty, derived from the model’s output likelihoods, and (2) reasoning consistency, based on agreement across multiple reasoning paths or sampled explanations. Using these signals, they build an adaptive verification and routing strategy: if confidence is high, the LLM answers directly; if uncertainty or inconsistency is detected, the system initiates targeted retrieval; if ambiguity remains high, it escalates to a deeper, more extensive search. This routing mechanism integrates with retrieval-augmented generation but triggers retrieval only when indicated by low PCC confidence.

Result: Across three difficult fact-checking benchmarks, PCC provides more accurate uncertainty estimates than using the model’s own verbalized confidence. It yields better factual accuracy and reliability than strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines while reducing unnecessary retrieval calls, thus improving efficiency. The framework is shown to transfer well across different underlying LLMs, indicating good generalization.

Conclusion: Combining probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency allows more accurate estimation of LLM factual confidence. This enables a confidence-guided, adaptive fact-checking pipeline that decides when to rely on internal knowledge and when to invoke retrieval or deep search. The approach improves both reliability and efficiency relative to existing fact-checking methods and generalizes across models, suggesting PCC is a practical way to reduce hallucinations in real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring factual accuracy, yet their outputs often contain hallucinated responses. While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.

### [6] [DataParasite Enables Scalable and Repurposable Online Data Curation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02578)
*Mengyi Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline that uses large language models to automate and scale web-based data collection for computational social science, substantially cutting costs while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational social science often depends on datasets built by manually collecting and integrating information from many heterogeneous online sources. This manual curation is slow, expensive, hard to reproduce, and difficult to adapt to new research questions. While recent LLM-based agentic search tools can query the web and extract structured information, existing systems are usually opaque, not easily configurable, and poorly aligned with the transparent, reproducible needs of scientific data curation. The authors aim to create a reusable, flexible, and transparent pipeline that reduces technical and labor barriers to assembling such datasets.

Method: The authors design DataParasite as an open-source, modular pipeline that decomposes tabular data curation into independent, entity-level web search and extraction tasks. Users specify what to collect using lightweight configuration files written in natural language, defining entities, fields, and search instructions. A single, task-agnostic Python script then executes these configurations, orchestrating agentic web search and structured extraction via large language models. The same infrastructure can be repurposed across tasks, including scenarios without predefined entity lists, by changing only the natural-language configuration, not the core code. The system is evaluated empirically on multiple canonical data-collection tasks in computational social science.

Result: Across several benchmark tasks—such as compiling faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories—DataParasite attains high extraction accuracy while reducing the cost of data collection by roughly an order of magnitude compared with traditional manual curation. These results suggest that the pipeline can deliver both substantial efficiency gains and quality comparable to or better than hand-assembled datasets for typical computational social science use cases.

Conclusion: DataParasite demonstrates that a single, configurable LLM-driven pipeline can generalize across diverse online data curation tasks in computational social science. By decoupling task specification (via simple configuration files and natural-language instructions) from execution (through a shared Python script), it lowers both technical and labor requirements. The approach yields scalable, transparent, and reusable data assembly workflows, positioning DataParasite as a practical foundation for building and sharing high-quality datasets in computational social science and potentially other data-intensive research domains.

Abstract: Many questions in computational social science rely on datasets assembled from heterogeneous online sources, a process that is often labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to reproduce. Recent advances in large language models enable agentic search and structured extraction from the web, but existing systems are frequently opaque, inflexible, or poorly suited to scientific data curation. Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions. We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories. Across tasks, DataParasite achieves high accuracy while reducing data-collection costs by an order of magnitude relative to manual curation. By lowering the technical and labor barriers to online data assembly, DataParasite provides a practical foundation for scalable, transparent, and reusable data curation in computational social science and beyond.

### [7] [Reconstructing Item Characteristic Curves using Fine-Tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02580)
*Christopher Ormerod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They fine-tune LLMs to mimic students of different ability levels answering multiple-choice questions, then infer IRT parameters (difficulty, discrimination) from the simulated response curves instead of costly field testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical calibration of test items in Item Response Theory requires large-scale, expensive student field testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. This cost and data requirement limit rapid test development and iterative improvement. The authors want a cheaper, data-efficient way to estimate psychometric properties of items by leveraging recent advances in Large Language Models that can generate plausible student-like responses.

Method: They condition a Large Language Model (Qwen-3 dense series) on discrete ability descriptors (e.g., low, medium, high proficiency) and fine-tune it via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to generate answers to multiple-choice items. For each item and each ability level, they simulate many responses to estimate the probability of a correct answer as a function of ability. From these empirical probabilities they reconstruct synthetic Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) and fit standard IRT models to extract item parameters like difficulty and discrimination. They compare these estimates with those from traditional or baseline methods on real datasets (Grade 6 ELA items and BEA 2024).

Result: The LLM-based simulation produces ICCs whose derived IRT parameters are competitive with, and in some cases better than, baseline estimation techniques. The approach is especially strong in capturing item discrimination, i.e., how sharply an item distinguishes between different ability levels. On the tested datasets (Grade 6 ELA and BEA 2024), the method matches or outperforms traditional or simpler baselines in estimating item properties.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs to simulate responses of students at various ability levels is a viable alternative to full-scale field testing for IRT item calibration. By generating synthetic ICCs, the method can recover key psychometric parameters—especially discrimination—with good accuracy, potentially reducing the need for costly data collection. This opens a path toward more scalable, simulation-based assessment design, though further validation and generalization studies are likely needed.

Abstract: Traditional methods for determining assessment item parameters, such as difficulty and discrimination, rely heavily on expensive field testing to collect student performance data for Item Response Theory (IRT) calibration. This study introduces a novel approach that implicitly models these psychometric properties by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate student responses across a spectrum of latent abilities. Leveraging the Qwen-3 dense model series and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we train models to generate responses to multiple choice questions conditioned on discrete ability descriptors. We reconstruct the probability of a correct response as a function of student ability, effectively generating synthetic Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) to estimate IRT parameters. Evaluation on a dataset of Grade 6 English Language Arts (ELA) items and the BEA 2024 Shared Task dataset demonstrates that this method competes with or outperforms baseline approaches. This simulation-based technique seems particularly effective at modeling item discrimination.

### [8] [FlowPlan-G2P: A Structured Generation Framework for Transforming Scientific Papers into Patent Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02589)
*Kris W Pan,Yongmin Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents FlowPlan-G2P, a structured, multi-stage framework that converts scientific papers into legally compliant patent descriptions using concept graphs and graph-conditioned text generation, outperforming end-to-end LLM baselines in coherence and legal compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drafting patent descriptions demands high technical and legal expertise and differs significantly from writing scientific papers, making automated paper-to-patent conversion hard. Existing black-box text-to-text LLM approaches struggle with structural reasoning and legal constraint modeling, leading to poor logical organization and legal compliance. The authors aim to design a method that better reflects expert drafters’ cognitive workflow and handles domain-specific structure and constraints.

Method: The authors propose FlowPlan-G2P, which decomposes paper-to-patent generation into three stages: (1) Concept Graph Induction, where technical entities and their relationships are extracted and organized into a directed graph through expert-like reasoning; (2) Paragraph and Section Planning, where this graph is rearranged into coherent clusters mapped to canonical patent sections (e.g., background, summary, detailed description, claims); and (3) Graph-Conditioned Generation, where section-specific subgraphs and tailored prompts guide an LLM to generate legally compliant paragraphs. They compare this structured pipeline to end-to-end LLM baselines.

Result: Experiments show that FlowPlan-G2P yields patent drafts with better logical coherence and higher legal compliance compared to end-to-end large language model baselines, according to the reported evaluations.

Conclusion: FlowPlan-G2P introduces a new, structure-aware paradigm for automatically generating patent descriptions from scientific papers. By mirroring expert drafting workflows and using graph-based planning plus conditioned generation, it advances structured text generation methods for specialized, legally constrained domains such as patent drafting.

Abstract: Over 3.5 million patents are filed annually, with drafting patent descriptions requiring deep technical and legal expertise. Transforming scientific papers into patent descriptions is particularly challenging due to their differing rhetorical styles and stringent legal requirements. Unlike black-box text-to-text approaches that struggle to model structural reasoning and legal constraints, we propose FlowPlan-G2P, a novel framework that mirrors the cognitive workflow of expert drafters by reformulating this task into three stages: (1) Concept Graph Induction, extracting technical entities and relationships into a directed graph via expert-like reasoning; (2) Paragraph and Section Planning, reorganizing the graph into coherent clusters aligned with canonical patent sections; and (3) Graph-Conditioned Generation, producing legally compliant paragraphs using section-specific subgraphs and tailored prompts. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPlan-G2P significantly improves logical coherence and legal compliance over end-to-end LLM baselines. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for paper-to-patent generation and advances structured text generation for specialized domains.

### [9] [Scalable Construction of a Lung Cancer Knowledge Base: Profiling Semantic Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02604)
*Cesar Felipe Martínez Cisneros,Jesús Ulises Quiroz Bautista,Claudia Anahí Guzmán Solano,Bogdan Kaleb García Rivera,Iván García Pacheco,Yalbi Itzel Balderas Martínez,Kolawole John Adebayoc,Ignacio Arroyo Fernández*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build a scalable pipeline using Open Information Extraction and biomedical NLP tools to construct a lung cancer knowledge base from open-access PubMed papers, then show that fine-tuning T5 on the resulting triplets improves semantic performance on biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need high-quality, domain-specific training data, especially in oncology where accuracy and interpretability are crucial. Manually curated knowledge bases are costly and hard to scale. The authors want an automated, low-cost, and scalable way to turn biomedical literature into structured knowledge suitable for fine-tuning LLMs for lung cancer research.

Method: They design a multi-step pipeline: (1) use the MeSH thesaurus to identify lung cancer–related medical concepts; (2) filter PubMed to retain only open-access articles with permissive CC0-like licenses; (3) run Open Information Extraction to obtain (subject, relation, object) triplets from the text; (4) apply biomedical Named Entity Recognition to filter and enrich triplets to ensure they are medically relevant. They then use these triplets to perform Supervised Semantic Fine-Tuning of T5 models and evaluate performance using ROUGE and BERTScore compared to baselines.

Result: The pipeline yields a large-scale, domain-specific, and noise-aware set of lung cancer knowledge triplets. T5 models fine-tuned on this dataset show significantly better semantic performance and coherence, as measured by ROUGE and BERTScore, relative to models not trained on this resource or trained on less-structured data.

Conclusion: Automatically extracted OpenIE-based triplet knowledge bases, when constrained and enriched with biomedical ontologies and NER, can serve as effective, scalable, and low-cost resources for fine-tuning LLMs in oncology. The approach improves semantic quality and coherence of biomedical NLP models and offers a generalizable strategy for building domain-specific knowledge bases from literature.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into biomedical research offers new opportunities for domainspecific reasoning and knowledge representation. However, their performance depends heavily on the semantic quality of training data. In oncology, where precision and interpretability are vital, scalable methods for constructing structured knowledge bases are essential for effective fine-tuning. This study presents a pipeline for developing a lung cancer knowledge base using Open Information Extraction (OpenIE). The process includes: (1) identifying medical concepts with the MeSH thesaurus; (2) filtering open-access PubMed literature with permissive licenses (CC0); (3) extracting (subject, relation, object) triplets using OpenIE method; and (4) enriching triplet sets with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure biomedical relevance. The resulting triplet sets provide a domain-specific, large-scale, and noise-aware resource for fine-tuning LLMs. We evaluated T5 models finetuned on this dataset through Supervised Semantic Fine-Tuning. Comparative assessments with ROUGE and BERTScore show significantly improved performance and semantic coherence, demonstrating the potential of OpenIE-derived resources as scalable, low-cost solutions for enhancing biomedical NLP.

### [10] [Improved Evidence Extraction for Document Inconsistency Detection with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02627)
*Nelvin Tan,Yaowen Zhang,James Asikin Cheung,Fusheng Liu,Yu-Ching Shih,Dong Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves how large language models detect and localize inconsistencies within documents by introducing better evidence-extraction metrics and a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are powerful, their use for document inconsistency detection is underexplored. Existing work mostly focuses on deciding if an inconsistency exists, not on precisely identifying which sentences are inconsistent. There is a need for methods and metrics that can reliably extract and evaluate the exact evidence of inconsistencies, since this is crucial for downstream tasks like document verification, editing, and auditing.

Method: The authors focus on the evidence-extraction aspect of document inconsistency detection. They design new, more comprehensive metrics to evaluate how well systems extract the specific sentences that are inconsistent. Methodologically, they propose a redact-and-retry framework: parts of the document are redacted and the LLM is queried again, combined with constrained filtering strategies to more systematically surface and refine the set of sentences that constitute evidence of inconsistency. This is compared against simple, direct prompting of LLMs.

Result: Their experiments show that the redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering significantly improves the performance of LLMs on the task of detecting and extracting inconsistent sentences, when measured using their proposed evidence-extraction metrics. The experimental results support the claim that this structured interaction outperforms straightforward direct prompting baselines.

Conclusion: By introducing specialized evaluation metrics and a redact-and-retry with constrained filtering framework, the paper demonstrates that LLMs can be made substantially more effective at evidence-based document inconsistency detection. This suggests that carefully designed interaction protocols and targeted evaluation are key to unlocking LLM capabilities for fine-grained document analysis tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful in many domains due to their impressive abilities that arise from large training datasets and large model sizes. However, research on LLM-based approaches to document inconsistency detection is relatively limited. There are two key aspects of document inconsistency detection: (i) classification of whether there exists any inconsistency, and (ii) providing evidence of the inconsistent sentences. We focus on the latter, and introduce new comprehensive evidence-extraction metrics and a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering that substantially improves LLM-based document inconsistency detection over direct prompting. We back our claims with promising experimental results.

### [11] [Empirical Comparison of Encoder-Based Language Models and Feature-Based Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to Automated Scoring of Long Essays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02659)
*Kuo Wang,Haowei Hua,Pengfei Yan,Hong Jiao,Dan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They compare encoder-only language models and ensemble approaches for automated scoring of long essays and find that an ensemble-of-embeddings with gradient boosting works best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder-only language models like BERT variants usually have a 512-token limit, which makes it difficult to process and score long essays accurately. There is a need to understand how to best use such models, or combinations of them, to improve automated essay scoring performance on long texts.

Method: They fine-tuned several encoder-based language models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa) for essay scoring and built different ensemble systems: (1) ensembles that integrate embeddings from multiple encoder models, and (2) ensembles of traditional feature-based supervised models (Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM). All models were trained, validated, and tested on 17,307 essays with an 80/10/10 split. Performance was evaluated using Quadratic Weighted Kappa.

Result: The ensemble-of-embeddings model that combines multiple pre-trained language model representations and uses a gradient-boosting classifier as the meta-model significantly outperformed each individual encoder-only language model on the long essay scoring task.

Conclusion: Combining embeddings from multiple pre-trained encoder-based language models and feeding them into a gradient-boosting classifier is a more effective approach for automated scoring of long essays than relying on any single encoder-only language model, addressing limitations related to long-context processing.

Abstract: Long context may impose challenges for encoder-only language models in text processing, specifically for automated scoring of essays. This study trained several commonly used encoder-based language models for automated scoring of long essays. The performance of these trained models was evaluated and compared with the ensemble models built upon the base language models with a token limit of 512?. The experimented models include BERT-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa), ensemble models integrating embeddings from multiple encoder models, and ensemble models of feature-based supervised machine learning models, including Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. We trained, validated, and tested each model on a dataset of 17,307 essays, with an 80%/10%/10% split, and evaluated model performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa. This study revealed that an ensemble-of-embeddings model that combines multiple pre-trained language model representations with gradient-boosting classifier as the ensemble model significantly outperforms individual language models at scoring long essays.

### [12] [When Do Tools and Planning Help LLMs Think? A Cost- and Latency-Aware Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02663)
*Subha Ghoshal,Ali Al-Bustami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks planning-and-tools LLM agents versus simple one-shot prompting on two real-world tasks, showing that tools sometimes boost accuracy but at huge latency costs and with task-dependent benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time planning with external tools is increasingly popular for improving LLM reasoning, but we lack careful, empirical understanding of when this extra complexity is worthwhile given its latency and cost. The authors want to study this tradeoff in realistic tasks where different tools and agent behaviors are needed.

Method: They build agent workflows using LangChain and LangGraph and compare a simple one-shot prompting baseline to a plan–execute–replan agent that can call multiple task-specific tools. Tools include DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-based retrieval, and topical web search. They test two models (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) on 60 examples each from Event-QA and Reddit ChangeMyView (split into 3×20 subsets), measuring accuracy, end-to-end latency, and token-cost estimates under identical workflows.

Result: On the Event-QA task, the best tool-augmented workflow substantially increases accuracy (e.g., from 47.5% to 67.5% for GPT-4o), but latency explodes from about 8 seconds to around 317 seconds per example. On the CMV task, simple one-shot prompting works best: GPT-4o-mini reaches 75% accuracy at about 6 seconds, while adding planning and search makes the system much slower without consistent accuracy improvements. Complex multi-tool orchestration also reveals that the smaller model can fail more severely than the larger one under the same agent design.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of planning-plus-tools agents is highly task-dependent and comes with large latency and cost overheads. Event-centric structured QA can benefit from tool use despite the cost, whereas persuasive response generation in CMV does not. Designers should make task-specific, cost-aware choices about both model size and the complexity of agent planning and tooling rather than assuming more tools and planning are always better.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time planning and external tools to improve reasoning. We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV). Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan--execute--replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search). We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\% $\rightarrow$ 67.5\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\sim$8s $\rightarrow$ $\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\% at $\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades. Overall, the findings highlight the need for task-specific, cost-aware choices of both model size and agent/tooling complexity.

### [13] [Towards Comprehensive Stage-wise Benchmarking of Large Language Models in Fact-Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02669)
*Hongzhan Lin,Zixin Chen,Zhiqi Shen,Ziyang Luo,Zhen Ye,Jing Ma,Tat-Seng Chua,Guandong Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FactArena is an automated, arena-style framework to evaluate LLMs on the full fact-checking pipeline, not just claim verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM fact-checking evaluations mostly test whether models label pre-given claims as true or false, ignoring earlier stages like identifying claims and retrieving evidence. This narrow focus hides systematic reasoning failures and robustness issues that arise in realistic end-to-end fact-checking workflows. The authors want a benchmark that reflects real deployment and exposes deeper weaknesses.

Method: They design FactArena, which automates a complete fact-checking pipeline and evaluates LLMs in an arena-style setup. (i) An LLM-driven process standardizes claim decomposition, tool-augmented evidence retrieval, and justification-based verdict prediction. (ii) An arena-style judging mechanism, with unified guidelines, performs pairwise comparisons among models while controlling for judge heterogeneity. (iii) A claim-evolution module adaptively generates harder, semantically controlled claims from seed data to stress-test factual robustness. They apply this to 16 SOTA LLMs from seven families and compute rankings and analyses.

Result: FactArena yields stable, interpretable rankings for 16 contemporary LLMs and exposes large gaps between their performance on simple static claim-verification tasks and their true end-to-end fact-checking capability. This demonstrates that many models that look strong under traditional metrics underperform when evaluated across all stages of the fact-checking workflow.

Conclusion: Holistic, pipeline-level evaluation is necessary for understanding and improving LLMs used in fact-checking. FactArena provides a scalable, trustworthy framework for diagnosing factual reasoning weaknesses, guiding model development, and supporting safer deployment of LLMs in real-world, safety-critical fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world fact-checking systems, yet existing evaluations focus predominantly on claim verification and overlook the broader fact-checking workflow, including claim extraction and evidence retrieval. This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation. The proposed framework offers a scalable and trustworthy paradigm for diagnosing LLMs' factual reasoning, guiding future model development, and advancing the reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical fact-checking applications.

### [14] [Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Aligned LLMs via Lexical Anchor Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02670)
*Devang Kulshreshtha,Hang Su,Chinmay Hegde,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes LATS, an attacker-LLM-free, highly query-efficient jailbreak method using lexical anchor tree search over multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak attacks reach high attack success rates but are costly because they typically rely on separate attacker LLMs and large query budgets, and often generate opaque, random-looking prompts. There is a need for a simpler, interpretable, and more query-efficient approach that does not depend on a dedicated attacker model.

Method: Reformulate jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn conversations. Starting from benign prompts, each node in the search tree injects a subset of missing content words—lexical anchors—from the target harmful goal. The search explores sequences of such injections to steer the assistant toward producing the full targeted output, without using an attacker LLM, only lexical manipulation and dialogue structure.

Result: On AdvBench and HarmBench benchmarks, LATS attains 97–100% attack success rate on recent GPT, Claude, and Llama models, while requiring on average about 6.4 queries per successful attack, significantly fewer than the 20+ queries needed by prior methods.

Conclusion: Conversational structure and gradual lexical anchor injection form a powerful, under-protected attack vector for jailbreaking LLMs. LATS shows that high attack success can be combined with strong query efficiency, highlighting a pressing need to harden dialogue-based defenses. The authors plan to release code to facilitate reproducibility and further study.

Abstract: Most jailbreak methods achieve high attack success rates (ASR) but require attacker LLMs to craft adversarial queries and/or demand high query budgets. These resource limitations make jailbreaking expensive, and the queries generated by attacker LLMs often consist of non-interpretable random prefixes. This paper introduces Lexical Anchor Tree Search (), addressing these limitations through an attacker-LLM-free method that operates purely via lexical anchor injection. LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, where each node incrementally injects missing content words from the attack goal into benign prompts. Evaluations on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on latest GPT, Claude, and Llama models with an average of only ~6.4 queries, compared to 20+ queries required by other methods. These results highlight conversational structure as a potent and under-protected attack surface, while demonstrating superior query efficiency in an era where high ASR is readily achievable. Our code will be released to support reproducibility.

### [15] [Extracting books from production language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02671)
*Ahmed Ahmed,A. Feder Cooper,Sanmi Koyejo,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper empirically studies how much copyrighted training data can be directly extracted from major production LLMs, showing that substantial verbatim text can still be retrieved despite safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an ongoing legal and technical debate about whether and how LLMs memorize copyrighted training data, and whether that content can be recovered from model outputs. Prior work showed extraction from open-weight models, but it was unclear if similar attacks work on closed, production-grade systems with safety layers. This gap matters for copyright risk assessment, regulation, and model design.

Method: The authors design a two-phase extraction procedure. Phase 1 is a probe that tests whether a model can be induced to continue a passage from a target book, sometimes using a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak in which many prompts are tried and the best continuation is selected. Phase 2 uses iterative continuation prompts to extend the extracted text and reconstruct as much of the book as possible. They run this procedure on four major production LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 3). Extraction success is quantified with an nv-recall metric based on a block-level approximation to longest common substring between the output and the ground-truth text.

Result: Different models show very different levels of extractable memorized content. For Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3, the authors can extract large portions of copyrighted books without needing a jailbreak (e.g., nv-recall around 76.8% and 70.3% respectively for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone). For Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1, a Best-of-N jailbreak is required to get high overlap; when jailbroken, Claude 3.7 Sonnet can output nearly entire books almost verbatim (nv-recall up to 95.8%), whereas GPT-4.1 requires many more BoN attempts and frequently halts with refusals, yielding low total extraction (e.g., nv-recall about 4.0%).

Conclusion: Production LLMs, even with model-level training mitigations and system-level safety policies, still memorize and can be induced to output significant amounts of copyrighted training data, sometimes nearly entire books. Safety measures differ substantially across providers and affect both the ease and scale of extraction, but they do not eliminate the underlying copyright-leakage risk. This underscores the need for stronger technical and policy safeguards and better understanding of memorization behaviors in deployed systems.

Abstract: Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%). Taken together, our work highlights that, even with model- and system-level safeguards, extraction of (in-copyright) training data remains a risk for production LLMs.

### [16] [Iterative Structured Pruning for Large Language Models with Multi-Domain Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02674)
*Guangxin Wu,Hao Zhang,Zhang Zhibin,Jiafeng Guo,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A structured pruning framework for large language models that removes redundant channels using hybrid multi-domain calibration and iterative calibration, achieving high compression with little performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are very large and expensive to deploy due to high compute, memory, and latency costs. Unstructured pruning can reduce size but creates irregular sparsity that needs special hardware or software, limiting practical deployment. There is a need for a pruning method that is both effective and compatible with standard accelerators.

Method: The paper proposes a structured pruning framework that removes entire architectural components (e.g., channels) instead of individual weights. It uses a hybrid multi-domain calibration set that gathers representative data from various tasks and domains, and an iterative calibration strategy that repeatedly evaluates model behavior to identify and prune redundant channels while maintaining performance. Pruning decisions are guided by how much each channel contributes across the calibration data, and the process is performed iteratively to avoid large, harmful pruning steps.

Result: Across multiple LLM architectures and a variety of downstream tasks, the method substantially compresses models (reducing parameters and computation) while maintaining accuracy and task performance close to the original dense models. The experiments demonstrate consistent gains in model size reduction and speed/efficiency with only minor performance drops.

Conclusion: Structured, channel-level pruning guided by hybrid multi-domain and iterative calibration is a practical and effective way to compress LLMs without requiring specialized hardware or software. It yields models that are smaller and faster yet still perform well on diverse tasks, making LLM deployment more feasible in real-world settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their ever-growing scale introduces significant barriers to real-world deployment, including substantial computational overhead, memory footprint, and inference latency. While model pruning presents a viable solution to these challenges, existing unstructured pruning techniques often yield irregular sparsity patterns that necessitate specialized hardware or software support. In this work, we explore structured pruning, which eliminates entire architectural components and maintains compatibility with standard hardware accelerators. We introduce a novel structured pruning framework that leverages a hybrid multi-domain calibration set and an iterative calibration strategy to effectively identify and remove redundant channels. Extensive experiments on various models across diverse downstream tasks show that our approach achieves significant compression with minimal performance degradation.

### [17] [EvoRoute: Experience-Driven Self-Routing LLM Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02695)
*Guibin Zhang,Haiyang Yu,Kaiming Yang,Bingli Wu,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoRoute, a dynamic model-routing paradigm for complex agentic AI systems that reduces cost and latency while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-LLM agentic systems achieve strong performance on complex, multi-step tasks but suffer from very high economic cost and latency. There is a fundamental and underexplored trade-off between performance, monetary cost, and speed (latency), which the authors formalize as the Agent System Trilemma. Current systems typically use static, pre-defined model assignments that do not adapt per step or task, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The authors propose EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing framework. Instead of using a fixed mapping from tasks to models, EvoRoute leverages an ever-growing knowledge base of prior interactions to dynamically select, at each step of an agent’s operation, a Pareto-optimal LLM backbone that balances accuracy, efficiency, and resource usage. EvoRoute treats model selection as a policy that can be continuously refined based on feedback from the environment, effectively learning how to route subtasks among different LLMs over time.

Result: On challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+, integrating EvoRoute into off-the-shelf agentic systems preserves or improves their task performance while significantly cutting execution cost (up to 80% reduction) and latency (over 70% reduction).

Conclusion: EvoRoute provides a practical solution to the Agent System Trilemma by enabling adaptive, feedback-driven model routing in multi-LLM agentic systems. It shows that dynamic, experience-based selection of LLM backbones can simultaneously retain high performance and substantially reduce both cost and latency, outperforming static routing strategies.

Abstract: Complex agentic AI systems, powered by a coordinated ensemble of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool and memory modules, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on intricate, multi-turn tasks. However, this success is shadowed by prohibitive economic costs and severe latency, exposing a critical, yet underexplored, trade-off. We formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Agent System Trilemma}: the inherent tension among achieving state-of-the-art performance, minimizing monetary cost, and ensuring rapid task completion. To dismantle this trilemma, we introduce EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing paradigm that transcends static, pre-defined model assignments. Leveraging an ever-expanding knowledge base of prior experience, EvoRoute dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLM backbones at each step, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and resource use, while continually refining its own selection policy through environment feedback. Experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+ demonstrate that EvoRoute, when integrated into off-the-shelf agentic systems, not only sustains or enhances system performance but also reduces execution cost by up to $80\%$ and latency by over $70\%$.

### [18] [Boosting Accuracy and Interpretability in Multilingual Hate Speech Detection Through Layer Freezing and Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02697)
*Meysam Shirdel Bilehsavar,Negin Mahmoudi,Mohammad Jalili Torkamani,Kiana Kiashemshaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and explains transformer models for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection across five languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online platforms need robust tools to automatically detect both sentiment and hate speech in multiple languages to maintain safe digital environments. Existing systems often lack strong multilingual performance and interpretability, making it hard to trust and debug their predictions.

Method: The authors fine-tune and compare three transformer-based models—BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen—for two tasks: sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. They evaluate them on datasets in English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. They incorporate the LIME explanation framework to highlight which words most influence each model’s predictions, thereby analyzing model behavior and interpretability.

Result: From the abstract, the precise numerical results are not given, but the study reports comparative performance of the three transformer models across the five languages and two tasks, along with qualitative insights from LIME about which tokens drive the models’ decisions.

Conclusion: The work shows that combining state-of-the-art multilingual transformer architectures with the LIME explainability framework can yield more effective and transparent systems for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection, supporting safer and more understandable content moderation tools.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis focuses on identifying the emotional polarity expressed in textual data, typically categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Hate speech detection, on the other hand, aims to recognize content that incites violence, discrimination, or hostility toward individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Both tasks play a critical role in online content moderation by enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material, thereby contributing to safer digital environments. In this study, we examine the performance of three transformer-based models: BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen, for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. The evaluation is conducted across five languages: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French. The models are compared using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To enhance model interpretability and provide deeper insight into prediction behavior, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework, which highlights the contribution of individual words to the models decisions. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architectures with explainability techniques, this work aims to improve both the effectiveness and transparency of multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection systems.

### [19] [Adversarial Question Answering Robustness: A Multi-Level Error Analysis and Mitigation Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02700)
*Agniv Roy Choudhury,Vignesh Ponselvan Rajasingh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how to make transformer-based QA models more robust to adversarial attacks like AddSent by analyzing failures and proposing targeted, entity-aware contrastive learning, which nearly closes the performance gap between clean and adversarial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong scores on benchmarks such as SQuAD, QA models are easily fooled by adversarially constructed inputs (e.g., AddSent), exposing brittleness that limits real-world reliability. Existing work often either scales models or applies generic adversarial training without deeply understanding error types or using linguistically informed mitigation strategies. The authors aim to systematically characterize where transformers fail under adversarial perturbations and to design targeted, linguistically grounded techniques to improve robustness without sacrificing accuracy on clean data.

Method: The authors evaluate transformer-based QA models (ELECTRA-small and ELECTRA-base) on the AddSent adversarial dataset, varying model scale and adversarial training ratios. They conduct a multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes to classify failure modes such as negation confusion and entity substitution. They explore different mixtures of clean vs. adversarial data during fine-tuning to find an optimal training ratio. They run data augmentation experiments to probe capacity limits in smaller models. Finally, they implement three targeted mitigation strategies, including a Named Entity Recognition (NER)-guided, entity-aware contrastive learning approach that explicitly trains models to distinguish correct entities from adversarial distractors.

Result: They find that negation-related errors and entity substitution are the dominant causes of adversarial failures. An 80% clean and 20% adversarial fine-tuning mix yields the best trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy. Small models show a capacity bottleneck: adding more adversarial data can hurt clean performance, reflecting a robustness-accuracy trade-off. Scaling up from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) largely removes this trade-off, improving both adversarial and clean performance simultaneously. Among the mitigation strategies, the NER-guided entity-aware contrastive learning method performs best, reaching 89.89% Exact Match (EM) on AddSent and 90.73% EM on SQuAD, closing about 94.9% of the adversarial performance gap.

Conclusion: Transformer QA robustness to adversarial attacks like AddSent is strongly impacted by specific linguistic phenomena, especially negation and entity substitutions. Adversarial robustness can be substantially improved through a combination of appropriate adversarial training ratios, model scaling, and targeted, linguistically informed mitigation techniques. In particular, NER-guided entity-aware contrastive learning nearly equalizes performance between adversarial and clean settings, suggesting that fine-grained, error-mode-specific training objectives are an effective path toward robust QA systems. The work is presented as the first to jointly perform comprehensive linguistic error analysis and apply NER-guided contrastive learning for adversarial QA, demonstrating near-parity between clean and adversarial performance.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems achieve impressive performance on standard benchmarks like SQuAD, but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. This project investigates the adversarial robustness of transformer models on the AddSent adversarial dataset through systematic experimentation across model scales and targeted mitigation strategies. We perform comprehensive multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes, identifying negation confusion and entity substitution as the primary failure modes. Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models. Scaling from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) eliminates the robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving substantial improvements on both clean and adversarial data. We implement three targeted mitigation strategies, with Entity-Aware contrastive learning achieving best performance: 89.89% AddSent Exact Match (EM) and 90.73% SQuAD EM, representing 94.9% closure of the adversarial gap. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating comprehensive linguistic error analysis with Named Entity Recognition (NER)-guided contrastive learning for adversarial QA, demonstrating that targeted mitigation can achieve near-parity between clean and adversarial performance.

### [20] [Mitigating Prompt-Induced Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02739)
*Jinbo Hao,Kai Yang,Qingzhen Su,Yang Chen,Yifan Li,Chao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They add a code-driven knowledge-graph exploration module into a knowledge-distillation chain-of-thought framework to reduce prompt-induced hallucinations in LLMs, significantly improving HIT@k metrics and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate, especially when prompts induce speculative or incorrect reasoning. Existing methods to reduce hallucinations still struggle to systematically constrain the reasoning process and to integrate reliable external knowledge in a structured, verifiable way. The paper aims to provide a more controllable reasoning pipeline that reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy by leveraging code and knowledge graphs.

Method: Starting from a knowledge distillation chain-style model, the authors add a code module that automatically explores a knowledge graph and produces structured external knowledge. This code output is embedded into the chain-of-thought prompts as an additional, verifiable information source. They redesign the knowledge-distillation chain to analyze and constrain the LLM’s reasoning based on this code-derived knowledge. The approach is implemented and evaluated with GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 across multiple public benchmarks, measuring HIT@1/3/5 to assess hallucination mitigation and inference accuracy.

Result: In experiments on several public datasets using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3, adding the code-guided knowledge-graph module yields substantial gains: HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively. In multiple settings, the method pushes HIT@1/3/5 above 95%, indicating not only improved top-1 accuracy but also strong performance among the top candidate answers. The model also demonstrates better contextual understanding and reduced frequency of prompt-induced hallucinations.

Conclusion: Integrating a code module for knowledge-graph exploration into a chain-of-thought knowledge-distillation framework effectively constrains LLM reasoning and mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations. This design substantially boosts HIT@k metrics and yields more accurate, verifiable model outputs, suggesting that code-driven external knowledge integration is a promising direction for making LLMs more reliable and trustworthy in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: To address hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes a method for mitigating prompt-induced hallucinations. Building on a knowledge distillation chain-style model, we introduce a code module to guide knowledge-graph exploration and incorporate code as part of the chain-of-thought prompt, forming an external knowledge input that provides more accurate and structured information to the model. Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating code modules significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 improve by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method achieves HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These results indicate that the proposed approach substantially reduces hallucination behavior while improving the accuracy and verifiability of large language models.

### [21] [Language Hierarchization Provides the Optimal Solution to Human Working Memory Limits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02740)
*Luyao Chen,Weibo Gao,Junjie Wu,Jinshan Wu,Angela D. Friederici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that the hierarchical structure of human language is an optimal solution to working memory limitations, supported by a computational likelihood model and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the long-standing question of why human language is hierarchically structured rather than purely linear, and to link this property to cognitive constraints, specifically limited working memory capacity (WMC).

Method: The authors define a likelihood function that measures how closely the average number of processing units in a sentence matches human working memory capacity. They compute its maximum likelihood estimate (θ̂_MLE), show it equals the mean number of units, and run computational simulations on artificial symbol sequences under different processing strategies (linear vs hierarchical). They then validate their findings on natural language sentences and compare patterns with known developmental changes in children’s WMC.

Result: Hierarchical processing of sequences keeps θ̂_MLE within human working memory limits much more effectively than linear processing, particularly as sentence length increases. The hierarchical model scales well with longer inputs and exhibits convergence patterns that parallel the developmental increase in children’s WMC.

Conclusion: Hierarchical sentence structure provides an efficient way to process language within human working memory constraints, which the authors argue offers a principled explanation for why human language universally exhibits hierarchical organization.

Abstract: Language is a uniquely human trait, conveying information efficiently by organizing word sequences in sentences into hierarchical structures. A central question persists: Why is human language hierarchical? In this study, we show that hierarchization optimally solves the challenge of our limited working memory capacity. We established a likelihood function that quantifies how well the average number of units according to the language processing mechanisms aligns with human working memory capacity (WMC) in a direct fashion. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully. It also shows a converging pattern related to children's WMC development. These results suggest that constructing hierarchical structures optimizes the processing efficiency of sequential language input while staying within memory constraints, genuinely explaining the universal hierarchical nature of human language.

TL;DR: Proposes Synapse, a unified memory architecture for LLM agents that uses a dynamic graph and spreading activation instead of static vector retrieval, achieving better long-term, multi-hop, temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard retrieval-augmented generation struggles with long-term agent memory because it relies on static vector similarity, leading to disconnected memories and issues like contextual tunneling. There is a need for a memory system that better captures associative, temporal, and multi-hop relationships, inspired by cognitive science.

Method: Introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), which represents memory as a dynamic graph. Relevance is computed via spreading activation, enhanced with lateral inhibition to suppress irrelevant nodes and temporal decay to downweight older information. They implement a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy that combines geometric embedding similarity with activation-based graph traversal over this memory graph.

Result: On the LoCoMo benchmark for long-term, complex temporal, and multi-hop reasoning, Synapse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval and memory methods, particularly addressing failures due to contextual tunneling.

Conclusion: Dynamic, graph-based associative memory with spreading activation and hybrid retrieval offers a more robust way to support LLM agents’ long-term reasoning than static vector similarity alone, effectively mitigating contextual tunneling and improving performance on challenging reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generalized reasoning, standard retrieval-augmented approaches fail to address the disconnected nature of long-term agentic memory. To bridge this gap, we introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), a unified memory architecture that transcends static vector similarity. Drawing from cognitive science, Synapse models memory as a dynamic graph where relevance emerges from spreading activation rather than pre-computed links. By integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, the system dynamically highlights relevant sub-graphs while filtering interference. We implement a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy that fuses geometric embeddings with activation-based graph traversal. Comprehensive evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark show that Synapse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in complex temporal and multi-hop reasoning tasks, offering a robust solution to the "Contextual Tunneling" problem. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### [23] [Window-based Membership Inference Attacks Against Fine-tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02751)
*Yuetian Chen,Yuntao Du,Kaiyuan Zhang,Ashish Kundu,Charles Fleming,Bruno Ribeiro,Ninghui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new membership inference attack method for LLMs that uses localized, window-based loss patterns instead of global average loss, significantly improving the ability to detect whether specific data was in the fine-tuning set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks on LLMs mostly rely on global metrics such as average loss over entire sequences. These global signals dilute the fine-grained, local memorization patterns that LLMs exhibit, causing weaker attacks and potentially underestimating privacy risks. The authors aim to design an attack that better aligns with how memorized content appears in models—locally and context-dependently—so as to more accurately measure privacy leakage in fine-tuned LLMs.

Method: They introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), a membership inference attack framework. The method slides windows of various sizes across a text sequence and, for each window, compares the loss produced by the target model with that of a reference model. Each window outputs a binary vote on whether the text is likely to be in the target model’s training data based on this loss comparison. These votes are aggregated using a sign-based scheme, and windows of geometrically spaced sizes are ensembled, allowing the method to capture memorization ranging from token-level to phrase-level patterns.

Result: Across eleven datasets, WBC outperforms standard membership inference baselines. It yields higher AUC scores and provides 2–3x higher detection rates in the low false-positive regime, indicating a stronger and more reliable ability to distinguish training samples from non-training samples in fine-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: The study concludes that membership evidence in LLMs is inherently local rather than global: aggregating localized loss signals via window-based comparison is substantially more effective than relying on global average loss. This exposes stronger privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs than previously measured, suggesting that current practices may underestimate the risk of training data exposure and that defenses must consider localized memorization patterns.

Abstract: Most membership inference attacks (MIAs) against Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on global signals, like average loss, to identify training data. This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds. Our findings reveal that aggregating localized evidence is fundamentally more effective than global averaging, exposing critical privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs.

### [24] [EComStage: Stage-wise and Orientation-specific Benchmarking for Large Language Models in E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02752)
*Kaiyan Zhao,Zijie Meng,Zheyong Xie,Jin Duan,Yao Hu,Zuozhu Liu,Shaosheng Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EComStage is a benchmark to evaluate LLM-based e-commerce agents not only on final task success but on intermediate reasoning stages (Perception, Planning, Action) across both customer- and merchant-oriented scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLM-based agents in e-commerce focus mainly on whether the final task is completed, ignoring the quality of intermediate reasoning steps like understanding user intent, planning actions, and executing them. This leaves a gap in diagnosing where models succeed or fail in complex, real-world agent workflows and gives little guidance for improving stage-wise decision-making. The authors want a finer-grained, realistic evaluation framework that reflects how agents should operate in production e-commerce systems for both customers and merchants.

Method: The authors design EComStage, a unified stage-wise benchmark for e-commerce agents. It decomposes agent behavior into three stages—Perception (intent understanding), Planning (action plan formulation), and Action (execution)—and covers seven representative tasks across diverse e-commerce scenarios. The dataset is fully human-annotated and quality-checked. The benchmark includes both customer-facing tasks (e.g., product inquiry, recommendation, order management) and merchant-facing tasks (e.g., promotion management, content review, operational support). They then evaluate over 30 LLMs of varying sizes (1B–200B+ parameters), including open-source and closed-source models, measuring performance per stage and per orientation (customer vs merchant).

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that different models exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses at different reasoning stages and across customer/merchant orientations. Larger or more advanced models do not uniformly dominate; instead, performance varies, revealing stage-specific and orientation-specific capability patterns. The benchmark produces fine-grained metrics that expose where models fail in the pipeline (e.g., misunderstanding intent vs poor planning vs bad action execution).

Conclusion: EComStage offers a comprehensive, realistic, and fine-grained framework for evaluating LLM-based e-commerce agents. By focusing on the full stage-wise reasoning process and including both customer- and merchant-oriented tasks, it enables more precise diagnosis of model behavior and provides actionable insights for designing, selecting, and optimizing LLM-based agents in real-world e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in e-commerce applications to assist customer services in tasks such as product inquiries, recommendations, and order management. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate whether these agents successfully complete the final task, overlooking the intermediate reasoning stages that are crucial for effective decision-making. To address this gap, we propose EComStage, a unified benchmark for evaluating agent-capable LLMs across the comprehensive stage-wise reasoning process: Perception (understanding user intent), Planning (formulating an action plan), and Action (executing the decision). EComStage evaluates LLMs through seven separate representative tasks spanning diverse e-commerce scenarios, with all samples human-annotated and quality-checked. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus only on customer-oriented interactions, EComStage also evaluates merchant-oriented scenarios, including promotion management, content review, and operational support relevant to real-world applications. We evaluate a wide range of over 30 LLMs, spanning from 1B to over 200B parameters, including open-source models and closed-source APIs, revealing stage/orientation- specific strengths and weaknesses. Our results provide fine-grained, actionable insights for designing and optimizing LLM-based agents in real-world e-commerce settings.

TL;DR: MiMo-V2-Flash is a 309B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts language model with only 15B active parameters, using hybrid attention, multi-token prediction, and a new multi-teacher distillation scheme to achieve strong reasoning and fast inference comparable to larger open models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models with strong reasoning and agentic abilities are computationally expensive, slow at inference, and often require very large parameter counts and context windows. There is a need for models that maintain top-tier performance while being more efficient in terms of active parameters, training/inference compute, and long-context handling, and that can effectively absorb specialized capabilities from multiple expert systems (e.g., RL-trained agents).

Method: The authors design a large Mixture-of-Experts model (309B total, 15B active) with a hybrid attention scheme combining Sliding Window Attention (128-token window) and global attention in a 5:1 ratio. They pre-train it on 27T tokens using Multi-Token Prediction with a native 32k context, later extended to 256k. For post-training, they propose Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD), where multiple domain-specialized teacher models provide dense, token-level reward signals to teach the student their expertise. They also repurpose the MTP head as an internal draft model for speculative decoding to accelerate inference.

Result: MiMo-V2-Flash matches or rivals the performance of leading open-weight models like DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2 while using only half or one-third of their total parameters. The MOPD approach successfully transfers teacher capabilities, and the speculative decoding with three MTP layers yields up to a 3.6-token average acceptance length and about 2.6x decoding speedup at inference. The model supports extended contexts up to 256k tokens.

Conclusion: A carefully designed MoE architecture with hybrid attention, large-scale MTP pre-training, and multi-teacher on-policy distillation can deliver state-of-the-art reasoning and agentic performance with significantly fewer active parameters and faster inference. MiMo-V2-Flash demonstrates that such models can be both powerful and efficient, and the release of its weights and MTP components aims to catalyze further open research on scalable, high-speed, long-context language models.

Abstract: We present MiMo-V2-Flash, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 309B total parameters and 15B active parameters, designed for fast, strong reasoning and agentic capabilities. MiMo-V2-Flash adopts a hybrid attention architecture that interleaves Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with global attention, with a 128-token sliding window under a 5:1 hybrid ratio. The model is pre-trained on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), employing a native 32k context length and subsequently extended to 256k. To efficiently scale post-training compute, MiMo-V2-Flash introduces a novel Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) paradigm. In this framework, domain-specialized teachers (e.g., trained via large-scale reinforcement learning) provide dense and token-level reward, enabling the student model to perfectly master teacher expertise. MiMo-V2-Flash rivals top-tier open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2, despite using only 1/2 and 1/3 of their total parameters, respectively. During inference, by repurposing MTP as a draft model for speculative decoding, MiMo-V2-Flash achieves up to 3.6 acceptance length and 2.6x decoding speedup with three MTP layers. We open-source both the model weights and the three-layer MTP weights to foster open research and community collaboration.

### [26] [Punctuation-aware Hybrid Trainable Sparse Attention for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02819)
*Junxiang Qiu,Shuo Wang,Zhengsu Chen,Hengheng Zhang,Jinda Lu,Changcheng Li,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHSA, a punctuation-aware hybrid sparse attention mechanism that improves long-context modeling efficiency and accuracy over dense and existing sparse attention schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense attention in LLMs scales quadratically with sequence length, making long-context processing computationally prohibitive. Existing sparse attention methods try to address this but use coarse block-level semantics, which ignore fine-grained boundaries inside blocks and cause loss of important information. There is a need for a sparse attention mechanism that is both highly efficient and better aligned with the natural semantic structure of text.

Method: The authors propose PHSA (Punctuation-aware Hybrid Sparse Attention), a natively trainable sparse attention framework. It uses punctuation tokens as anchors for semantic boundaries. First, a dual-branch aggregation mechanism combines global semantic representations with punctuation-enhanced boundary features, preserving key semantic structures with minimal extra compute. Second, they design an extreme-sparsity-adaptive training and inference strategy to keep the model stable even when only a very small fraction of tokens are active, enabling very high sparsity levels without performance collapse.

Result: On general benchmarks and long-context tests, PHSA consistently surpasses both dense attention and state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, including InfLLM v2. For a 0.6B-parameter model with 32k-token inputs and a sparsity ratio of 97.3%, PHSA reduces information loss by 10.8%, demonstrating that it can maintain more useful information under extreme sparsity.

Conclusion: PHSA shows that leveraging punctuation as semantic boundary anchors and combining it with a dual-branch aggregation plus sparsity-adaptive training yields a more effective sparse attention scheme. It achieves strong long-context performance while operating at very high sparsity, outperforming dense and leading sparse baselines and indicating a promising direction for scalable long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Attention serves as the fundamental mechanism for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs), yet dense attention becomes structurally prohibitive for long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Consequently, sparse attention has received increasing attention as a scalable alternative. However, existing sparse attention methods rely on coarse-grained semantic representations during block selection, which blur intra-block semantic boundaries and lead to the loss of critical information. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{P}unctuation-aware \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{S}parse \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{(PHSA)}, a natively trainable sparse attention framework that leverages punctuation tokens as semantic boundary anchors. Specifically, (1) we design a dual-branch aggregation mechanism that fuses global semantic representations with punctuation-enhanced boundary features, preserving the core semantic structure while introducing almost no additional computational overhead; (2) we introduce an extreme-sparsity-adaptive training and inference strategy that stabilizes model behavior under very low token activation ratios; Extensive experiments on general benchmarks and long-context evaluations demonstrate that PHSA consistently outperforms dense attention and state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines, including InfLLM v2. Specifically, for the 0.6B-parameter model with 32k-token input sequences, PHSA can reduce the information loss by 10.8\% at a sparsity ratio of 97.3\%.

### [27] [The performances of the Chinese and U.S. Large Language Models on the Topic of Chinese Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02830)
*Feiyan Liu,Chenxun Zhuo,Siyan Zhao,Bao Ge,Tianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares Chinese- and U.S.-developed LLMs on Chinese-culture questions and finds Chinese models perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used worldwide, their cultural background and training sources may embed cultural biases or strengths. With most top LLM developers located in China and the U.S., it is important to understand whether models from these regions differ in their handling of Chinese cultural content, especially in Chinese-language contexts where cultural nuance matters for education, communication, and applications targeting Chinese users.

Method: The authors use a direct-questioning evaluation paradigm: they pose Chinese-language questions about traditional Chinese culture—covering history, literature, poetry, and related areas—to multiple frontier LLMs, including GPT-5.1, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-Max, and Gemini 2.5Pro. They then compare answer correctness and possibly other quality metrics between models developed in China and those developed in the U.S.

Result: Chinese-developed LLMs generally obtain higher accuracy on questions related to traditional Chinese culture than U.S.-developed models. Within the U.S.-developed group, Gemini 2.5Pro and GPT-5.1 achieve relatively better performance compared to other U.S. models but still tend to lag behind leading Chinese models on these tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit cultural performance differences that appear to correlate with their development origin. Models from Chinese developers demonstrate stronger capabilities in Chinese cultural knowledge tasks than their U.S. counterparts, likely due to differences in training data composition, localization strategies, and the explicit emphasis placed on Chinese cultural content during development. This underscores the need to consider cultural coverage and localization when training and deploying LLMs.

Abstract: Cultural backgrounds shape individuals' perspectives and approaches to problem-solving. Since the emergence of GPT-1 in 2018, large language models (LLMs) have undergone rapid development. To date, the world's ten leading LLM developers are primarily based in China and the United States. To examine whether LLMs released by Chinese and U.S. developers exhibit cultural differences in Chinese-language settings, we evaluate their performance on questions about Chinese culture. This study adopts a direct-questioning paradigm to evaluate models such as GPT-5.1, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-Max, and Gemini2.5Pro. We assess their understanding of traditional Chinese culture, including history, literature, poetry, and related domains. Comparative analyses between LLMs developed in China and the U.S. indicate that Chinese models generally outperform their U.S. counterparts on these tasks. Among U.S.-developed models, Gemini 2.5Pro and GPT-5.1 achieve relatively higher accuracy. The observed performance differences may potentially arise from variations in training data distribution, localization strategies, and the degree of emphasis on Chinese cultural content during model development.

### [28] [TiMem: Temporal-Hierarchical Memory Consolidation for Long-Horizon Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02845)
*Kai Li,Xuanqing Yu,Ziyi Ni,Yi Zeng,Yao Xu,Zheqing Zhang,Xin Li,Jitao Sang,Xiaogang Duan,Xuelei Wang,Chengbao Liu,Jie Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiMem is a temporal–hierarchical memory framework for long-horizon conversational agents that organizes and consolidates dialogue history into a tree, improving accuracy and efficiency of memory recall for personalization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon conversational agents quickly exceed LLM context windows, and existing memory frameworks do not handle temporally structured, multi-level information well. This causes fragmented memories and unstable personalization over long interactions. The paper aims to design a memory system that explicitly models temporal continuity and hierarchy, enabling robust long-term personalization without exploding context length.

Method: The authors propose TiMem, which structures conversational history as a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT). Raw dialogue observations are incrementally consolidated into higher-level, more abstract persona representations along the temporal hierarchy. TiMem has three main mechanisms: (1) temporal–hierarchical organization via TMT to capture both fine-grained events and coarser summaries over time; (2) semantic-guided consolidation, which integrates related memories across levels using semantic similarity and structure, all without fine-tuning the underlying LLM; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall, which adaptively chooses how much and which level of the hierarchy to retrieve depending on query complexity, trading off precision and efficiency.

Result: In a unified evaluation setting, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon personalization benchmarks, scoring 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It surpasses all compared baselines while cutting the average length of recalled memories by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis of the learned memory representations shows clear separation between different personas on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S, indicating more coherent and robust persona modeling.

Conclusion: TiMem demonstrates that treating temporal continuity as a primary organizing principle for memory substantially improves long-horizon conversational agents. By combining temporal–hierarchical structure, semantic consolidation, and complexity-aware recall, it offers more accurate, efficient, and stable personalization from extended dialogue histories, setting a new state of the art on relevant benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-horizon conversational agents have to manage ever-growing interaction histories that quickly exceed the finite context windows of large language models (LLMs). Existing memory frameworks provide limited support for temporally structured information across hierarchical levels, often leading to fragmented memories and unstable long-horizon personalization. We present TiMem, a temporal--hierarchical memory framework that organizes conversations through a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT), enabling systematic memory consolidation from raw conversational observations to progressively abstracted persona representations. TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis indicates clear persona separation on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S. Overall, TiMem treats temporal continuity as a first-class organizing principle for long-horizon memory in conversational agents.

### [29] [To Generate or Discriminate? Methodological Considerations for Measuring Cultural Alignment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02858)
*Saurabh Kumar Pandey,Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP) to more reliably evaluate how well LLMs recognize and adapt to users’ cultural and demographic signals, avoiding confounds present in standard socio-demographic prompting (SDP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard socio-demographic prompting (asking models to speak as if they were from a certain demographic group) often yields stereotypical and biased outputs and is also highly sensitive to prompt wording, decoding choices, and the inherent difficulty of open-ended generation. This makes it hard to tell whether poor cultural alignment reflects actual model bias or just task and prompt design. The authors want a cleaner, more discriminative way to measure whether LLMs actually encode and can use demographic information reflected in user behavior.

Method: They propose inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where instead of asking the model to role-play a demographic group, they ask it to infer/predict a user’s demographic proxy (India, Mexico, USA) from that user’s behavior traces. They use the Goodreads-CSI dataset, which records which English book reviews are difficult for readers from different countries. Four LLMs—Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1—are evaluated on their ability to classify demographic proxies from (a) real user behavior and (b) simulated behavior produced by LLMs. They also compare performance at aggregated vs. individual-user levels to probe personalization limits.

Result: Across models, ISDP shows that LLMs more accurately recover demographic proxies from actual user behavior than from simulated behavior, which contradicts what standard SDP-based evaluations would suggest. Yet, when moving from group-level or aggregate data down to individual users, performance with both real and simulated behaviors drops and converges to similar levels, pointing to limited ability to finely personalize to individuals based on the available signals.

Conclusion: ISDP provides a more controlled and interpretable framework for studying LLMs’ cultural and demographic competence than traditional socio-demographic prompting. The experiments on Goodreads-CSI reveal that models encode more usable information in genuine behavioral data than in LLM-generated simulations, but that this advantage shrinks at the individual level, highlighting current limits in user-level personalization and suggesting caution in interpreting SDP-based bias and competency assessments.

Abstract: Socio-demographic prompting (SDP) - prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) using demographic proxies to generate culturally aligned outputs - often shows LLM responses as stereotypical and biased. While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users. We use the Goodreads-CSI dataset (Saha et al., 2025), which captures difficulty in understanding English book reviews for users from India, Mexico, and the USA, and test four LLMs: Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1 with ISDP. Results show that models perform better with actual behaviors than simulated ones, contrary to what SDP suggests. However, performance with both behavior types diminishes and becomes nearly equal at the individual level, indicating limits to personalization.

### [30] [TWIST: Training-free and Label-free Short Text Clustering through Iterative Vector Updating with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06747)
*I-Fan Lin,Faegheh Hasibi,Suzan Verberne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free, label-free LLM-guided method for clustering short texts on top of any embedder, tailored for real-world chatbot utterances where labels and cluster counts are unknown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In customer-facing chatbots and similar applications, companies collect massive amounts of short user utterances that must be grouped by intent. However, they typically lack labeled data and do not know the number of intent clusters in advance. Existing strong methods often rely on contrastive learning, labels, or prior cluster knowledge, making them costly or impractical in real-world, low-resource commercial settings. There is a need for a scalable, model-agnostic clustering approach that works without labels or training and fits realistic deployment constraints.

Method: The paper introduces a training-free, label-free clustering procedure built on any pre-existing text embedder. It first constructs sparse “cluster prototype” vectors from representative texts. Then, in an iterative process, these vectors are refined using guidance from a large language model, which adjusts them to better capture underlying intent structure. This iterative vector updating is decoupled from any particular embedding model, and can be combined with various downstream clustering algorithms. The approach is designed to limit LLM usage, thereby controlling cost and enabling scale to large datasets.

Result: Across diverse short-text datasets, the proposed method matches or outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning-based clustering techniques, despite not using labels or prior knowledge of the number of clusters. The experiments further demonstrate that it remains effective when paired with relatively small LLMs, works with different text embedders and clustering algorithms, and scales to large collections of utterances while reducing the overall computational burden on the LLM component.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that iterative LLM-guided vector refinement on top of generic embedders offers an effective, training-free and label-free solution for short-text clustering, especially in commercial chatbot scenarios. Because it is model-agnostic, works with small LLMs, requires no prior cluster information, and scales efficiently, the method is argued to align better with real-world, low-resource deployment conditions than existing clustering approaches based on contrastive learning and stronger supervision.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free and label-free method for short text clustering that can be used on top of any existing embedder. In the context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning, but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world scenarios than existing clustering methods.

### [31] [Training Language Models with homotokens Leads to Delayed Overfitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02867)
*Adrian Cosma,Stefan Ruseti,Emilian Radoi,Mihai Dascalu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using alternative but meaning-equivalent subword tokenizations (“homotokens”) as a form of data augmentation to make language models invariant to tokenization choices, improving generalization and robustness, especially in data-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subword tokenization is non-unique: many different token sequences can represent the same text but cause different internal computations in language models. Current models are trained on a single canonical tokenization, making them sensitive to arbitrary tokenizer decisions and potentially prone to overfitting in data-scarce regimes. The authors aim to exploit this latent variability as a principled, meaning-preserving data augmentation method and to improve tokenization invariance without changing model interfaces or objectives.

Method: They formalize “homotokens” as all valid subword segmentations of a token sequence that decode to the same surface text. They then design a lightweight training architecture that, during next-token prediction, conditions the model on randomly sampled homotoken variants. This is done via an auxiliary causal encoder that processes the homotokenized sequence and a block-causal cross-attention mechanism that injects this information into the main model. Crucially, they keep the standard next-token prediction objective and external token interface unchanged; the augmentation operates only internally during training.

Result: In data-constrained pretraining experiments, introducing homotoken-based augmentation systematically delays overfitting when the same data is seen multiple times and yields better generalization on a range of downstream evaluation benchmarks. In multilingual fine-tuning experiments, they observe that the benefits of homotokens depend on tokenizer characteristics: the largest gains appear when the canonical tokenizer is highly compressive (aggressive merging), whereas benefits shrink or disappear when the tokenizer already fragments text heavily (over-segmentation).

Conclusion: Homotokens—alternative, meaning-equivalent subword segmentations—serve as a simple, modular, and strictly meaning-preserving data augmentation scheme for language models. By conditioning training on homotoken variants via an auxiliary encoder and cross-attention, models become more invariant to tokenization idiosyncrasies, overfitting is reduced in low-data pretraining, and generalization can improve, particularly when the underlying tokenizer is compressive rather than over-fragmented.

Abstract: Subword tokenization introduces a computational layer in language models where many distinct token sequences decode to the same surface form and preserve meaning, yet induce different internal computations. Despite this non-uniqueness, language models are typically trained using a single canonical longest-prefix tokenization. We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input. Overall, homotokens provide a simple and modular mechanism for inducing tokenization invariance in language models.

### [32] [LongBench Pro: A More Realistic and Comprehensive Bilingual Long-Context Evaluation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02872)
*Ziyang Chen,Xing Wu,Junlong Jia,Chaochen Gao,Qi Fu,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongBench Pro is a realistic, large-scale bilingual benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding in LLMs, created via a human–model collaborative pipeline and used to reveal key limitations and design trade-offs in current long-context models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-context benchmarks either use synthetic tasks that fail to capture real-world complexity or require expensive manual annotation that does not scale to very long inputs and diverse scenarios. As LLM context windows rapidly expand to hundreds of thousands of tokens, there is a pressing need for scalable, realistic, and fine-grained benchmarks that can reliably evaluate and analyze long-context understanding across tasks, lengths, and languages.

Method: The authors build LongBench Pro, a benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese, covering 11 primary and 25 secondary tasks with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. They design a multi-dimensional taxonomy characterizing each instance by context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels determined by model performance). To construct the dataset scalably yet reliably, they introduce a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: strong LLMs are used to draft challenging questions, reference answers, rationales, and solution processes; human experts then verify correctness, refine or reject problematic cases, and ensure quality. They then evaluate 46 widely used long-context LLMs on this benchmark using task-specific metrics to derive empirical findings about model behavior.

Result: Using LongBench Pro to evaluate 46 long-context LLMs, the authors find: (1) targeted long-context optimization methods (such as specialized training or architectural modifications) improve long-context comprehension more effectively than simply increasing model parameters; (2) the practical or effective context length of many models is significantly shorter than their advertised maximum context window, and this mismatch is particularly notable across languages (English vs. Chinese); and (3) “thinking” or reasoning-style prompting mostly benefits models that were originally trained with native reasoning capabilities, while mixed-thinking strategies can achieve better trade-offs between performance and cost or complexity.

Conclusion: LongBench Pro offers a robust, realistic, and fine-grained benchmark for assessing and analyzing long-context understanding in LLMs across English and Chinese and a wide variety of tasks. The benchmark, together with the human–model collaborative construction pipeline, reveals important limitations of current long-context models—such as inflated effective context claims and language asymmetries—and highlights that specialized long-context optimization and carefully designed thinking paradigms are more impactful than simple scale, thereby providing a valuable testbed and guidance for future long-context model development.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of context length in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks. Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the "thinking" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off. In summary, LongBench Pro provides a robust testbed for advancing long-context understanding.

### [33] [Revisiting Data Compression with Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02875)
*Chen-Han Tsai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how large language models can be used as practical data compressors and presents a new state-of-the-art adjusted compression rate on a standard benchmark without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although large language models have shown strong compression performance on text and multimodal data, it is unclear whether they can practically replace traditional compression algorithms due to issues like efficiency, robustness across data types, and the need for task-specific training. The work aims to better understand and improve practical compression performance—especially the adjusted compression rate—using off-the-shelf LLMs.

Method: The authors treat LLMs as probabilistic models for data sequences and explore different configurations and techniques to lower the adjusted compression rate, including prompt and context design, encoding strategies, and adaptation for various data types (English text, non-English text, code, and raw byte streams). They do this without additional model training, focusing instead on usage strategies and configuration choices for the LLM during compression.

Result: On the enwik9 benchmark, the proposed methods achieve a new state-of-the-art adjusted compression rate of about 18% using an LLM with no further training. The authors also demonstrate that LLM-based compressors perform strongly on text-heavy domains and remain competitive on non-natural text, such as code and byte-level sequences, when properly configured.

Conclusion: LLMs can act as highly effective data compressors, achieving SOTA adjusted compression rates on standard text benchmarks without additional training. While they are strongest on natural language data, they can still provide competitive compression on more structured or low-level data types when used with appropriate configurations, suggesting that LLM-based compression is a viable and flexible alternative or complement to traditional compression methods.

Abstract: In this report, we investigate the potential use of large language models (LLM's) in the task of data compression. Previous works have demonstrated promising results in applying LLM's towards compressing not only text, but also a wide range of multi-modal data. Despite the favorable performance achieved, there still remains several practical questions that pose a challenge towards replacing existing data compression algorithms with LLM's. In this work, we explore different methods to achieve a lower adjusted compression rate using LLM's as data compressors. In comparison to previous works, we were able to achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) adjusted compression rate of around $18\%$ on the enwik9 dataset without additional model training. Furthermore, we explore the use of LLM's in compressing non-English data, code data, byte stream sequences. We show that while LLM's excel in compressing data in text-dominant domains, their ability in compressing non-natural text sequences still remain competitive if configured in the right way.

### [34] [Transparent Semantic Change Detection with Dependency-Based Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02891)
*Bach Phan-Tat,Kris Heylen,Dirk Geeraerts,Stefano De Pascale,Dirk Speelman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable, dependency-based method for lexical semantic change detection that rivals or beats neural embedding approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lexical semantic change (LSC) detection methods mainly use neural embedding-based distributional representations, which, although accurate, are opaque and hard to interpret. The authors seek a more transparent approach that can still achieve strong performance, allowing researchers to better understand why a word is judged to have changed meaning over time.

Method: Instead of neural embeddings, the method uses syntactic dependency co-occurrence patterns: it collects how target words co-occur with other words along dependency relations (e.g., subject, object, modifier) across different time periods. It then compares these structured co-occurrence profiles across time slices to detect changes in usage/meaning. The approach is evaluated against standard LSC benchmarks and compared with multiple distributional semantic models.

Result: The dependency-based approach is effective for semantic change detection and, on several benchmarks, outperforms a number of state-of-the-art distributional semantic models that rely on neural embeddings. The authors also obtain predictions that align well with existing gold standards of semantic change.

Conclusion: Dependency co-occurrence patterns provide a competitive and more interpretable alternative to embedding-based methods for lexical semantic change detection. The approach offers strong performance while yielding plausible and human-understandable explanations for why words are classified as having changed meaning over time.

Abstract: Most modern computational approaches to lexical semantic change detection (LSC) rely on embedding-based distributional word representations with neural networks. Despite the strong performance on LSC benchmarks, they are often opaque. We investigate an alternative method which relies purely on dependency co-occurrence patterns of words. We demonstrate that it is effective for semantic change detection and even outperforms a number of distributional semantic models. We provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the predictions, showing that they are plausible and interpretable.

### [35] [Linear Script Representations in Speech Foundation Models Enable Zero-Shot Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02906)
*Ryan Soh-Eun Shim,Kwanghee Choi,Kalvin Chang,Ming-Hao Hsu,Florian Eichin,Zhizheng Wu,Alane Suhr,Michael A. Hedderich,David Harwath,David R. Mortensen,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a way to directly control the writing script (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic) of multilingual speech recognition outputs by editing the internal activations of large speech foundation models like Whisper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual speech models are trained on mixed, web-scale data where the same language can appear in multiple regional varieties that use different writing systems. This leads to non-deterministic and sometimes undesired scripts in ASR output (e.g., the same language transcribed in different scripts). There is a need for a reliable way to choose and enforce a target script at inference time without retraining models.

Method: The authors analyze the representation space (activations) of multilingual speech models and show that script information is encoded approximately linearly. They then construct script direction vectors in this activation space and modify model activations at inference by adding these vectors. This activation editing is used to steer the model toward a desired script, even for language–script combinations not seen during training.

Result: Adding learned script vectors to activations at test time successfully changes the script of the transcriptions produced by Whisper, including for atypical language–script pairings (e.g., Italian in Cyrillic, Japanese in Latin). When used for post-hoc control of script in ASR output, the method achieves competitive recognition performance across all Whisper model sizes while enforcing the desired script.

Conclusion: Script is linearly encoded in multilingual speech model activations and can be controlled at inference via simple activation editing. This enables effective, post-hoc control over the script of ASR outputs without retraining and works even for non-standard language–script pairings, while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy across model scales.

Abstract: Multilingual speech foundation models such as Whisper are trained on web-scale data, where data for each language consists of a myriad of regional varieties. However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy for theoretical understanding of LLMs across six stages, reviews core theories, and outlines frontier challenges to move from heuristic engineering to principled science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are highly successful in practice but poorly understood theoretically, leading to their treatment as black boxes and a fragmented research landscape. There is a need for a coherent framework that connects empirical progress with underlying theory and mechanisms.

Method: Introduce a lifecycle-based taxonomy with six stages (Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, Evaluation) and, within each stage, systematically review existing foundational theories, mechanisms, and open problems related to LLM performance and behavior.

Result: The survey organizes scattered theoretical work into a structured framework, analyzes issues like data mixture justification, architectural representational limits, and alignment optimization dynamics, and identifies frontier challenges such as limits of synthetic data, bounds on safety guarantees, and origins of emergent intelligence.

Conclusion: By framing LLM research along a lifecycle taxonomy and connecting empirical findings with theoretical analysis, the work offers a roadmap for evolving LLM development from ad-hoc engineering practices toward a more rigorous, theory-driven scientific discipline.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has precipitated a profound paradigm shift in Artificial Intelligence, delivering monumental engineering successes that increasingly impact modern society. However, a critical paradox persists within the current field: despite the empirical efficacy, our theoretical understanding of LLMs remains disproportionately nascent, forcing these systems to be treated largely as ``black boxes''. To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance. Specifically, we analyze core theoretical issues such as the mathematical justification for data mixtures, the representational limits of various architectures, and the optimization dynamics of alignment algorithms. Moving beyond current best practices, we identify critical frontier challenges, including the theoretical limits of synthetic data self-improvement, the mathematical bounds of safety guarantees, and the mechanistic origins of emergent intelligence. By connecting empirical observations with rigorous scientific inquiry, this work provides a structured roadmap for transitioning LLM development from engineering heuristics toward a principled scientific discipline.

### [37] [Image, Word and Thought: A More Challenging Language Task for the Iterated Learning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02911)
*Hyoyeon Lee,Seth Bullock,Conor Houghton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A semi-supervised iterated learning model with an autoencoder architecture is used to study how language structure emerges when complex meanings (seven-segment display glyphs) are transmitted across generations, showing the emergence of an expressive, compositional, and stable code for 128 symbols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how structured, grammatical, and unambiguous languages can emerge purely from cultural transmission constraints, especially when learners start from scratch and face limited input, and to extend this investigation to more complex meaning spaces than previously studied.

Method: The authors use a semi-supervised iterated learning model implemented via an autoencoder that combines supervised and unsupervised learning. Agents learn and pass on a mapping between meanings and signals under a bottleneck limiting their training data. The meanings are complex visual patterns—seven-segment display images representing 128 distinct glyphs—and the model tracks how the internal code evolves over generations.

Result: When exposed to a transmission bottleneck, agents in the model develop a communication system in which each of the 128 glyphs is associated with a distinct signal (expressivity), where parts of the signal systematically correspond to parts of the meaning (compositionality), and where the resulting language remains unchanged across generations (stability).

Conclusion: The semi-supervised autoencoder-based iterated learning model can scale to complex meaning spaces and still yields emergent languages that are expressive, compositional, and stable, supporting the idea that cultural transmission constraints alone can drive the formation of structured linguistic codes, even for high-dimensional visual meanings.

Abstract: The iterated learning model simulates the transmission of language from generation to generation in order to explore how the constraints imposed by language transmission facilitate the emergence of language structure. Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.

### [38] [RAL2M: Retrieval Augmented Learning-To-Match Against Hallucination in Compliance-Guaranteed Service Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02917)
*Mengze Hong,Di Jiang,Jiangtao Wen,Zhiyang Su,Yawen Li,Yanjie Sun,Guan Wang,Chen Jason Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RAL2M, a framework that reduces hallucinations in LLM-based systems by treating LLMs as matching judges in a retrieval setup and using an ensemble of LLMs for more reliable decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often hallucinate, which is problematic for real-world service systems that must provide compliant, knowledge-grounded responses. Existing retrieval-augmented generation can still suffer from hallucination, both during response generation and during the model’s internal judgment of relevance or correctness. There is a need for a more robust paradigm that curbs hallucinations while still leveraging LLM strengths.

Method: The authors introduce Retrieval-Augmented Learning-to-Match (RAL2M), which reframes LLMs as query-response matching judges inside a retrieval-based architecture, rather than as free-form generators. They further propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble mechanism that explicitly models the heterogeneous competence and interdependence of multiple LLMs. This ensemble operates in latent space to produce a calibrated consensus decision about the correctness or relevance of candidate responses to queries.

Result: On large-scale benchmarks, RAL2M significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially in reducing hallucinations. The latent ensemble effectively exploits complementary strengths of different LLMs—"wisdom of the crowd"—leading to better calibrated and more reliable matching judgments.

Conclusion: Recasting LLMs as matching judges within a retrieval framework, complemented by a query-adaptive latent ensemble over multiple models, is an effective strategy to curb hallucination in LLM-driven services. The work suggests that further exploration of latent representations and ensemble reasoning can yield even more robust and compliant LLM-based systems, and the authors provide best-practice insights and future research directions in this area.

Abstract: Hallucination is a major concern in LLM-driven service systems, necessitating explicit knowledge grounding for compliance-guaranteed responses. In this paper, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Learning-to-Match (RAL2M), a novel framework that eliminates generation hallucination by repositioning LLMs as query-response matching judges within a retrieval-based system, providing a robust alternative to purely generative approaches. To further mitigate judgment hallucination, we propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble strategy that explicitly models heterogeneous model competence and interdependencies among LLMs, deriving a calibrated consensus decision. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" and significantly outperforms strong baselines. Finally, we discuss best practices and promising directions for further exploiting latent representations in future work.

### [39] [Memorization, Emergence, and Explaining Reversal Failures: A Controlled Study of Relational Semantics in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02931)
*Yihua Zhu,Qianying Liu,Jiaxin Wang,Fei Cheng,Chaoran Liu,Akiko Aizawa,Sadao Kurohashi,Hidetoshi Shimodaira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study of whether autoregressive LLMs actually learn logical properties of relations (symmetry, inversion) or just exhibit order bias, using synthetic KG-based data and custom-trained GPT-style models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although large language models can answer questions involving relational words (e.g., father, friend), it is unclear if they truly capture the underlying logical semantics of these relations, such as symmetry (friend-of is symmetric) or inversion (father-of vs. son-of). Moreover, known reversal-type failures—where models struggle with reversed question order—could be due to missing relational semantics or simply a bias from left-to-right generation. The paper aims to disentangle these factors and understand when and how relational semantics actually emerge in autoregressive models.

Method: The authors build a controlled synthetic framework rooted in a knowledge graph (KG). From symmetric and inverse triples in the KG, they generate textual training data encoding these relations. They then train GPT-style autoregressive transformers from scratch (including very shallow 2–3 layer models) on this data under varying degrees of “logic-bearing” supervision. They systematically evaluate three aspects: (1) memorization of seen triples; (2) logical inference using learned symmetry/inversion rules; and (3) in-context generalization to new entities not seen in training. They also run order-matched forward vs. reverse tests and construct a diffusion-based baseline model without left-to-right bias to isolate the effect of autoregressive ordering on performance.

Result: They observe a sharp phase transition: once the models receive enough logic-bearing supervision, relational semantics (such as symmetry and inversion rules) suddenly emerge, even in small, shallow models. Successful generalization—both logical inference and transfer to unseen entities—correlates with the presence of stable, interpretable signals in intermediate transformer layers. In order-matched experiments comparing forward and reversed prompts and in comparisons with a diffusion baseline, they find that most reversal failures are not due to missing inversion semantics; instead, they stem mainly from the inherent left-to-right order bias of autoregressive decoding.

Conclusion: Autoregressive transformers are capable of learning genuine relational semantics, including symmetry and inversion, given sufficient structured supervision, and this can happen even in relatively small, shallow models via a distinct phase transition. Stable intermediate-layer representations appear to underlie robust generalization. However, many reversal-type errors commonly interpreted as semantic failures are better explained by the autoregressive ordering bias rather than an inability to represent inversion logic, suggesting that architectural or decoding changes might mitigate such issues without requiring fundamentally different semantic learning.

Abstract: Autoregressive LLMs perform well on relational tasks that require linking entities via relational words (e.g., father/son, friend), but it is unclear whether they learn the logical semantics of such relations (e.g., symmetry and inversion logic) and, if so, whether reversal-type failures arise from missing relational semantics or left-to-right order bias. We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals. Finally, order-matched forward/reverse tests and a diffusion baseline indicate that reversal failures are primarily driven by autoregressive order bias rather than deficient inversion semantics.

### [40] [Pearmut: Human Evaluation of Translation Made Trivial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02933)
*Vilém Zouhar,Tom Kocmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pearmut is a lightweight platform that makes rigorous multilingual human evaluation as easy and routine as automatic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluation is the most reliable way to assess multilingual NLP systems, especially for tasks like machine translation, but it is rarely used because existing tooling is hard to set up, slow, and requires significant engineering and operational effort. Researchers often fall back on automatic metrics, even though they are imperfect, because running human studies is too costly and complex. There is a need for an easy-to-use, scalable, and feature-rich platform that lowers these barriers so that human evaluation can be incorporated regularly into model development.

Method: The authors design and implement Pearmut, a flexible evaluation platform focused on multilingual tasks and machine translation. It operationalizes standard human evaluation protocols such as Direct Assessment (DA), Error Span Annotation (ESA), and Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), while allowing extension to new protocols. The system supports document-level context, absolute and contrastive evaluations, and embeds quality-control mechanisms like attention checks and ESAAI pre-annotations. It also supports both static task assignment and active learning-based dynamic assignment strategies to optimize annotator effort and data collection. Overall, the method is a software and workflow design that integrates these features into a lightweight end-to-end solution.

Result: Pearmut provides a working, feature-complete platform that can conduct human evaluations with similar ease and speed to automatic metric computations. It supports multilingual evaluation scenarios, handles common protocols out of the box, and enables experimentation with new evaluation designs. Through its features—document context, different evaluation modes, quality checks, and assignment strategies—it reduces the engineering overhead and operational complexity that typically prevent frequent human evaluations.

Conclusion: By lowering the logistical and technical barriers to running human evaluations, Pearmut allows researchers and practitioners to incorporate reliable human assessment as a routine part of multilingual NLP and machine translation development. Instead of being an infrequent, heavyweight process, human evaluation can become a standard, practical component of model validation, error analysis, and benchmarking, enabling better-aligned and more trustworthy NLP systems.

Abstract: Human evaluation is the gold standard for multilingual NLP, but is often skipped in practice and substituted with automatic metrics, because it is notoriously complex and slow to set up with existing tools with substantial engineering and operational overhead. We introduce Pearmut, a lightweight yet feature-rich platform that makes end-to-end human evaluation as easy to run as automatic evaluation. Pearmut removes common entry barriers and provides support for evaluating multilingual tasks, with a particular focus on machine translation. The platform implements standard evaluation protocols, including DA, ESA, or MQM, but is also extensible to allow prototyping new protocols. It features document-level context, absolute and contrastive evaluation, attention checks, ESAAI pre-annotations and both static and active learning-based assignment strategies. Pearmut enables reliable human evaluation to become a practical, routine component of model development and diagnosis rather than an occasional effort.

### [41] [Enhancing Multilingual RAG Systems with Debiased Language Preference-Guided Query Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02956)
*Jeonghyun Park,Byeongjeong Kim,Seojin Hwang,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that the commonly observed preference of mRAG systems for English is largely an artifact of biased evaluation setups, and introduces a debiased metric (DeLP) plus a new framework (DELTA) that better exploit monolingual alignment and outperform English-pivot baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual RAG systems often appear to work best when queries and documents are routed through English (English pivoting). This is widely believed to be because LLMs and retrievers are intrinsically stronger in English. However, prior evaluations may be confounded by structural biases: more data, gold answers, and culturally central topics are concentrated in English, which can skew metrics and hide the true language behavior of models. The authors aim to disentangle genuine model preference from these structural confounds so we can design better mRAG systems for many languages, not just English.

Method: 1) They analyze common multilingual benchmarks and identify three key structural priors: exposure bias (models are more exposed to English training data), gold availability prior (answers and relevant evidence are disproportionately available in English), and cultural priors from topic locality (topics more centered on English-speaking regions). 2) They define DeLP, a calibrated metric that explicitly factors out these priors when measuring language preference, effectively controlling for evidence distribution and topic effects to isolate genuine model behavior. 3) Using insights from DeLP, they design DELTA, a lightweight mRAG framework that emphasizes monolingual alignment between the query and documents, rather than defaulting to English pivoting. DELTA leverages language-aware retrieval and text augmentation strategies to better match the query language with evidence while still enabling strong cross-lingual performance.

Result: Using DeLP, they find that the seemingly strong English preference in prior work mostly comes from how evidence and gold answers are distributed across languages, not from an inherent English bias in the retrievers. Instead, retrievers exhibit a more general preference for monolingual alignment (query and document in the same language). Based on this insight, DELTA achieves superior performance to English-pivot mRAG and other multilingual RAG baselines on a range of languages and benchmarks, demonstrating both better retrieval and generation quality.

Conclusion: When evaluation biases are corrected, mRAG systems do not inherently prefer English as strongly as previously believed; what they prefer is monolingual query-document alignment. By explicitly debiasing language preference measurement (DeLP) and exploiting the revealed preference via language-aware text augmentation (DELTA), multilingual RAG can be made more effective and equitable across languages, outperforming traditional English-pivoting strategies.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems often exhibit a perceived preference for high-resource languages, particularly English, resulting in the widespread adoption of English pivoting. While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DELTA consistently outperforms English pivoting and mRAG baselines across diverse languages.

### [42] [LLM-Augmented Changepoint Detection: A Framework for Ensemble Detection and Automated Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02957)
*Fabian Lukassen,Christoph Weisser,Michael Schlee,Manish Kumar,Anton Thielmann,Benjamin Saefken,Thomas Kneib*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an ensemble-based changepoint detection framework augmented with LLM-generated explanations for regime shifts in time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Changepoint methods each work well only on certain data types, making method choice hard and often suboptimal, and existing systems rarely provide automatic, contextual explanations for detected regime changes.

Method: Aggregate outputs from ten different statistical changepoint detection algorithms into an ensemble detector and pair this with an LLM-driven explanation pipeline that links detected changepoints to historical or contextual events; for private or specialized datasets, use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation setup over user-provided documents to ground explanations.

Result: The ensemble outperforms individual detection algorithms in accuracy and robustness across varied time series, and the LLM-based system can automatically produce contextual narratives that explain each detected changepoint; the whole approach is released as an open-source Python framework and demonstrated on multiple domains such as finance, political science, and environmental science.

Conclusion: Combining an ensemble of statistical changepoint detectors with LLM-based, RAG-enhanced explanation modules yields more accurate and interpretable regime-change analysis, turning raw detection outputs into actionable insights across diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel changepoint detection framework that combines ensemble statistical methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance both detection accuracy and the interpretability of regime changes in time series data. Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods. Additionally, an LLM-powered explanation pipeline automatically generates contextual narratives, linking detected changepoints to potential real-world historical events. For private or domain-specific data, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution enables explanations grounded in user-provided documents. The open source Python framework demonstrates practical utility in diverse domains, including finance, political science, and environmental science, transforming raw statistical output into actionable insights for analysts and decision-makers.

### [43] [Low-Resource Heuristics for Bahnaric Optical Character Recognition Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02965)
*Phat Tran,Phuoc Pham,Hung Trinh,Tho Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves OCR accuracy for the endangered Bahnar language by combining layout-aware detection (tables vs. non-tables) with probabilistic post-processing, raising accuracy from 72.86% to 79.26%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bahnar is a minority language with limited digital resources and research. Existing OCR systems perform poorly on degraded scans of Bahnar documents, causing high recognition errors that hinder information retrieval and language preservation. There is a need for methods tailored to noisy, low-resource, and complex-layout documents in underrepresented languages.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline that first detects and distinguishes table and non-table areas in scanned Bahnar documents to clean and structure the inputs for OCR. After standard OCR is applied, they use probability-based post-processing heuristics to correct likely recognition errors, presumably leveraging character/word likelihoods or confusion patterns. This two-stage approach—layout-aware preprocessing plus probabilistic post-correction—is evaluated on Bahnar document scans.

Result: On Bahnar language scanned documents, the proposed approach improves OCR recognition accuracy from 72.86% to 79.26%, indicating that the combination of advanced table/non-table detection and probabilistic error correction significantly reduces recognition errors caused by degraded image regions.

Conclusion: The method provides a measurable gain in OCR accuracy for Bahnar documents and thus supports better digitization and preservation of this minority language. The overall framework—layout-aware detection combined with probabilistic post-processing—can be adapted to other low-resource or minority languages facing similar document quality and data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Bahnar, a minority language spoken across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, faces significant preservation challenges due to limited research and data availability. This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with recognition accuracy increasing from 72.86% to 79.26%. This work contributes valuable resources for Bahnar language preservation and provides a framework applicable to other minority language digitization efforts.

### [44] [Correct, Concise and Complete: Multi-stage Training For Adaptive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02972)
*Nathanaël Carraz Rakotonirina,Ren Pang,Neha Anna John,Michael Bohlke-Schneider,Momchil Hardalov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an RL- and SFT-based method to reduce unnecessary chain-of-thought length in LLMs while preserving reasoning accuracy, achieving a better accuracy–length trade-off than prior efficient reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning improves LLM accuracy but often leads to excessively long explanations and overthinking, which increases computation cost and can even hurt performance. There is a need for methods that keep the benefits of explicit reasoning while minimizing redundant tokens and avoiding accuracy degradation.

Method: The authors introduce a multi-stage efficient reasoning framework. First, they apply supervised fine-tuning using either rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting to shape initial reasoning behavior. Then, they use reinforcement learning with an adaptive length penalty. They design a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer, while selectively rewarding self-verification behavior when it is empirically beneficial. Training optimizes the trade-off between correctness and brevity across diverse tasks.

Result: Across seven diverse reasoning benchmarks and for model sizes of 8B and 32B parameters, the method reduces average response length by 28% (8B) and 40% (32B), with only small accuracy drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. When evaluated with the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy metric and its area-under-curve variant (AUC_OAA), the approach scores 76.6, which is 5 points better than the base model and 2.5 points better than the second-best efficient reasoning method.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of SFT and RL with an adaptive length-penalizing reward yields a simple yet effective way to curb overthinking in LLM chain-of-thought reasoning. It substantially shortens responses while largely preserving accuracy and outperforms more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning techniques on an overthinking-aware evaluation metric.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved substantially through increased test-time computation, typically in the form of intermediate tokens known as chain-of-thought (CoT). However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy--response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\% for 8B models and 40\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\text{AUC}_{\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.

### [45] [Mechanistic Knobs in LLMs: Retrieving and Steering High-Order Semantic Features via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02978)
*Ruikang Zhang,Shuo Wang,Qi Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce a sparse-autoencoder-based method to find and edit specific internal features in LLMs that control high-level behaviors, and show it can reliably steer Big Five personality expressions in text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability can find internal features in LLMs, but connecting those features to reliable control of rich, behavior-level semantic attributes (like personality style in generated text) remains difficult. Existing activation steering methods are often unstable, entangled, and lack clear semantic interpretability at the feature level.

Method: They train or use sparse autoencoders to obtain a sparse feature basis over model activations, then design a contrastive retrieval pipeline using pairs of prompts or generations that differ along a controlled semantic opposition (e.g., high vs low on a Big Five trait). They apply statistical activation analysis on these contrastive settings to identify candidate features correlated with the semantic dimension, and then use generation-based validation to test whether intervening on each candidate feature yields semantically consistent changes. From this process they select monosemantic, functionally interpretable features. They then perform targeted feature-level interventions for steering and compare against Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA).

Result: On Big Five personality traits, their framework can retrieve internal features whose manipulation yields precise and bidirectional changes in generated text along the target traits. The resulting steering is more stable, interpretable, and preserves overall model performance better than CAA. They empirically observe that intervening on a single identified feature causes coherent, multi-dimensional linguistic shifts aligned with the target trait, which they term Functional Faithfulness.

Conclusion: LLMs contain sparse internal features that correspond to high-order, behavior-level semantic concepts like personality traits. These can be reliably surfaced using sparse autoencoders plus contrastive retrieval and validation, and then used for robust behavior steering. The discovered Functional Faithfulness effect suggests that these features encode integrated, concept-level functions, offering a promising mechanistic route for fine-grained regulation and alignment of complex AI behaviors.

Abstract: Recent work in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has enabled the identification and intervention of internal features in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.

### [46] [P-Check: Advancing Personalized Reward Model via Learning to Generate Dynamic Checklist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02986)
*Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces P-Check, a personalized reward modeling framework that generates dynamic, user-specific checklists to guide reward prediction and improve personalized text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized reward models mostly rely on static or implicit representations of user context, which cannot fully capture the dynamic, multi-dimensional nature of human judgments and preferences. There is a need for a more explicit and adaptable mechanism to represent what each user cares about when evaluating model outputs, so that reward models can better align with nuanced, personalized criteria and remain robust in diverse scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes P-Check, a framework that trains a plug-and-play checklist generator producing explicit, dynamic evaluation criteria conditioned on user preferences. These checklists are then used to guide reward prediction for model outputs. To better reflect individual nuances, the authors introduce Preference-Contrastive Criterion Weighting, a training strategy that assigns saliency weights to each checklist criterion based on its discriminative ability for personalized judgments, effectively highlighting the most preference-relevant factors.

Result: Experiments show that P-Check improves the accuracy of reward predictions compared to baselines, leads to better personalized downstream text generation, and maintains strong performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, indicating robustness and generalization of the learned personalized criteria.

Conclusion: P-Check demonstrates that dynamically generated, explicit checklists grounded in user preferences can significantly enhance personalized reward modeling. By weighting checklist criteria according to their contrastive importance for individualized judgments, the framework yields more accurate, robust, and practically useful personalized evaluations that also translate into higher-quality personalized generations.

Abstract: Recent approaches in personalized reward modeling have primarily focused on leveraging user interaction history to align model judgments with individual preferences. However, existing approaches largely treat user context as a static or implicit conditioning signal, failing to capture the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of human judgment. In this paper, we propose P-Check, a novel personalized reward modeling framework, designed to train a plug-and-play checklist generator that synthesizes dynamic evaluation criteria for guiding the reward prediction. To better align these checklists with personalized nuances, we introduce Preference-Contrastive Criterion Weighting, a training strategy that assigns saliency scores to criteria based on their discriminative power for personalized judgment. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that P-Check not only improves reward accuracy but also enhances downstream personalized generation, and remains robust in OOD scenarios.

### [47] [Mechanistic Interpretability of Large-Scale Counting in LLMs through a System-2 Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02989)
*Hosein Hasani,Mohammadali Banayeeanzade,Ali Nafisi,Sadegh Mohammadian,Fatemeh Askari,Mobin Bagherian,Amirmohammad Izadi,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that large language models fail on large counting tasks due to transformer depth limits, and introduces a simple test-time, System-2-style decomposition strategy that lets them accurately solve large-scale counting problems while revealing how counting is mechanistically implemented inside the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLMs can solve complex mathematical and reasoning tasks, they systematically underperform on seemingly simple counting problems, especially when the required count is large. This gap suggests a fundamental architectural limitation in transformers’ ability to scale counting with problem size. The authors aim to both overcome this limitation and mechanistically understand how LLMs implement a more deliberate, System-2-like counting process.

Method: The authors propose a test-time inference strategy inspired by System-2 cognition: decompose a large counting problem into several smaller, independent sub-counts that the model can reliably perform, then combine these partial results. They apply observational and causal mediation analyses to probe internal model activations and attention patterns while using this strategy. Mechanistic interpretability techniques are used to identify which representations and attention heads encode partial counts, how these latents are passed between steps, and how they are finally aggregated into a total count.

Result: Using the decomposition strategy, LLMs achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks that previously exceeded their effective capacity, thus surpassing limitations imposed by transformer depth. The mechanistic analyses reveal that latent count values are encoded in the final token representations of each sub-part, transmitted via specific attention heads across intermediate steps, and then combined in later layers to yield the final count output.

Conclusion: The work concludes that transformer-based LLMs indeed implement a System-2-like counting mechanism when guided by an appropriate test-time decomposition strategy. This procedure allows models to overcome inherent architectural depth limits for counting and substantially improves performance on large counting tasks. More broadly, the findings offer mechanistic insight into how structured reasoning can emerge and be enhanced in LLMs through simple, general-purpose inference-time interventions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite strong performance on complex mathematical problems, exhibit systematic limitations in counting tasks. This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks. This work provides mechanistic insight into System-2 counting in LLMs and presents a generalizable approach for improving and understanding their reasoning behavior.

### [48] [SentGraph: Hierarchical Sentence Graph for Multi-hop Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03014)
*Junli Liang,Pengfei Zhou,Wangqiu Zhou,Wenjie Qing,Qi Zhao,Ziwen Wang,Qi Song,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SentGraph is a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that models logical relations between sentences to improve multi-hop question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chunk-based RAG works well for single-hop QA but struggles with multi-hop QA, where answers depend on combining evidence scattered across multiple documents. Chunk retrieval often brings in irrelevant or incoherent text, breaking evidence chains and causing reasoning errors. The authors want a retrieval mechanism that can capture fine-grained logical dependencies across sentences and documents to better support multi-hop reasoning.

Method: The authors propose SentGraph, a hierarchical sentence-level graph for RAG. Offline, they build a graph where nodes are sentences and edges encode logical relations. They adapt Rhetorical Structure Theory to identify nucleus (central) and satellite (supporting) sentences, then group sentences into topic-level subgraphs. They also add cross-document edges via shared entities to connect related information across documents. Online, given a question, SentGraph performs graph-guided retrieval: it selects key evidence sentences and expands along graph paths to gather a coherent, fine-grained evidence set for the LLM to generate answers.

Result: On four standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, SentGraph outperforms traditional chunk-based RAG baselines and other strong methods. The experiments show improved answer accuracy and better evidence selection quality, indicating that modeling sentence-level logical relations helps maintain complete evidence chains.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling logical dependencies between sentences via a hierarchical sentence graph significantly improves retrieval for multi-hop QA in RAG systems. Sentence-level graph-guided retrieval yields more relevant, coherent evidence than chunk-based approaches, leading to better multi-hop reasoning performance by large language models.

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively supports single-hop question answering with large language models but faces significant limitations in multi-hop question answering tasks, which require combining evidence from multiple documents. Existing chunk-based retrieval often provides irrelevant and logically incoherent context, leading to incomplete evidence chains and incorrect reasoning during answer generation. To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges. During online retrieval, SentGraph performs graph-guided evidence selection and path expansion to retrieve fine-grained sentence-level evidence. Extensive experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SentGraph, validating the importance of explicitly modeling sentence-level logical dependencies for multi-hop reasoning.

### [49] [Stable-RAG: Mitigating Retrieval-Permutation-Induced Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02993)
*Qianchi Zhang,Hainan Zhang,Liang Pang,Hongwei Zheng,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new weakness in RAG systems—sensitivity to the order of retrieved documents—and proposes Stable-RAG, a method that stabilizes reasoning across different document permutations to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RAG helps reduce hallucinations in LLMs by grounding responses in retrieved documents, existing work mostly studies retrieval quality and positional bias. The authors notice that even when the correct (gold) document is present and fixed at the first position, simply permuting the remaining retrieved documents can substantially change the LLM’s answers. This permutation sensitivity is underexplored and can lead to unstable and hallucinated outputs, motivating a method that explicitly addresses this issue.

Method: The authors propose Stable-RAG, which (1) runs the LLM generator multiple times with different permutations of the retrieved documents; (2) collects the hidden states from these runs and clusters them to identify dominant reasoning patterns; (3) constructs a cluster-center representation that captures the main, stable reasoning trajectory; and (4) decodes the final answer from this center representation. Additionally, it uses the stable reasoning signal to adjust or align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging consistency across permutations. The method is evaluated under Top-5 retrieval where the gold document is included.

Result: On three question answering datasets, Stable-RAG yields higher answer accuracy and more consistent reasoning across permutations of the retrieved documents compared to standard RAG and other robust RAG baselines. The method also shows better robustness and generalization across different datasets, retrievers, and input lengths, indicating that it mitigates permutation-induced hallucinations effectively.

Conclusion: Permutation sensitivity in RAG is a significant and previously underexplored source of instability and hallucination, even when the correct document is retrieved and well-positioned. By explicitly modeling and aggregating over different retrieval orders via Stable-RAG, one can extract a stable reasoning pattern that improves factual accuracy, reasoning consistency, and robustness. This suggests that future RAG systems should consider robustness not only to retrieval quality and positional bias but also to permutations of retrieved evidence.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for reducing factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), yet little is known about how the order of retrieved documents affects model behavior. We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.

### [50] [Dementia-R1: Reinforced Pretraining and Reasoning from Unstructured Clinical Notes for Real-World Dementia Prognosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03018)
*Choonghan Kim,Hyunmin Hwang,Hangeol Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jinse Park,Jae-Sung Lim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework that improves longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes by first pre-training on intermediate clinical indices, then using RL for final status prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs do well on clinical text understanding but perform poorly on longitudinal prognosis tasks like predicting dementia progression, which require reasoning over complex, non-linear symptom trajectories across multiple visits. Supervised learning lacks labels for symptom evolution and pure RL is difficult due to sparse, binary outcome rewards. The authors want a method that can reason about disease progression over time from unstructured notes and overcome sparse-reward issues.

Method: They design Dementia-R1, which uses a Cold-Start Reinforcement Learning strategy. First, the model is pre-trained to predict verifiable intermediate clinical indices that can be extracted from patient histories (e.g., cognitive scores or other structured markers). This pre-training phase encourages the LLM to model disease progression and symptom dynamics. Then, using these capabilities, the model is further optimized with RL where the final reward is tied to correctly predicting the longitudinal dementia prognosis (final clinical status). The whole framework operates on unstructured clinical notes and leverages these indices as dense supervisory signals to mitigate sparse rewards.

Result: On real-world unstructured clinical datasets, Dementia-R1 reaches an F1 score of 77.03% for dementia prognosis. On the widely used ADNI benchmark, their 7B-parameter model performs on par with GPT-4o, especially in capturing fluctuating cognitive trajectories over time, indicating that the method effectively models longitudinal disease patterns.

Conclusion: By combining cold-start pre-training on intermediate clinical indices with RL fine-tuning, Dementia-R1 improves LLM-based longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured notes, handling complex, non-monotonic symptom trajectories. The approach mitigates sparse reward problems in RL and yields performance competitive with state-of-the-art large proprietary models, suggesting a promising direction for prognosis modeling in other longitudinal clinical tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical text understanding, they struggle with longitudinal prediction tasks such as dementia prognosis, which require reasoning over complex, non-monotonic symptom trajectories across multiple visits. Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets. Notably, on the ADNI benchmark, our 7B model rivals GPT-4o, effectively capturing fluctuating cognitive trajectories. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dementiar1-CDB5

### [51] [Large Reasoning Models Are (Not Yet) Multilingual Latent Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02996)
*Yihong Liu,Raoyuan Zhao,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large reasoning models perform internal, non-verbal (latent) reasoning across 11 languages, showing it is strong in high-resource languages and weaker in low-resource ones, and that internal prediction dynamics are largely English-centered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large reasoning models show strong performance, especially when using chain-of-thought explanations, prior work suggests that models often internally compute the correct answer before finishing these explanations. This latent reasoning has been studied primarily in English, leaving open whether and how it generalizes across languages. Understanding multilingual latent reasoning can reveal biases and limitations in current LRMs and inform better multilingual model design and evaluation.

Method: The authors use a truncation-based strategy on chain-of-thought outputs: they progressively cut off reasoning steps and check when the model’s internal prediction of the final answer becomes correct, thereby measuring stepwise latent prediction formation. They apply this across 11 languages and multiple benchmarks of varying difficulty. They then perform representational analyses of hidden states to compare how internal predictions evolve across languages and against English, assessing similarity in latent reasoning pathways.

Result: They find clear evidence that LRMs exhibit latent reasoning across many languages: models often internally reach the correct answer before finishing the textual chain-of-thought. However, the strength and clarity of this effect vary: it is strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource languages, and overall less visible on harder reasoning benchmarks. Representational analysis shows that, despite performance differences, the internal evolution of predictions is highly similar across languages and closely aligned with English.

Conclusion: Multilingual latent reasoning exists in LRMs but is uneven across languages and task difficulties, with stronger effects in high-resource languages. Internal representation dynamics suggest that models use a largely shared, English-centered latent reasoning pathway across languages. This implies that multilingual reasoning in LRMs is heavily influenced by English-centric training and may disadvantage low-resource languages, highlighting the need for more balanced multilingual training and evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, often attributed to their capability to generate explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation. Our results reveal clear evidence of multilingual latent reasoning, though unevenly: strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource ones, and broadly less observable on harder benchmarks. To understand whether these differences reflect distinct internal mechanisms, we further perform representational analyses. Despite surface-level disparities, we find that the internal evolution of predictions is highly consistent across languages and broadly aligns with English -- a pattern suggesting an English-centered latent reasoning pathway.

### [52] [Lil: Less is Less When Applying Post-Training Sparse-Attention Algorithms in Long-Decode Stage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03043)
*Junhao Hu,Fangze Li,Mingtao Xu,Feifan Meng,Shiju Zhao,Tiancheng Hu,Ting Peng,Anmin Liu,Wenrui Huang,Chenxu Liu,Ziyue Hua,Tao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that sparse attention in LLM decoding can unexpectedly increase total inference cost by causing longer generated sequences, and proposes an early-stopping method that cuts token usage by up to 90% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although sparse-attention methods are designed to speed up the decode stage of LLM inference by reducing time and memory complexity per token, in practice end-to-end efficiency also depends on how many tokens are generated. The authors are motivated by the observation that information loss from sparsity can harm generation quality in a way that forces models to generate longer outputs, offsetting or even reversing the theoretical efficiency gains. They aim to understand and resolve this mismatch between per-token efficiency and overall system efficiency.

Method: The authors empirically study LLM decoding with sparse attention and measure its impact on output length, latency, and accuracy on reasoning-heavy tasks. They complement this with a theoretical analysis showing how information loss from sparsity can lead to longer sequences. Based on these insights, they design an early-stopping algorithm that monitors the trade-off between information loss and information gain during sparse decoding and stops generation when information loss surpasses a learned or computed threshold. They then benchmark this method across multiple reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

Result: They find that sparse attention often causes the model to produce significantly longer sequences, increasing overall inference complexity despite lower per-token cost, a phenomenon they call "Less is Less" (Lil). Their proposed early-stopping algorithm substantially reduces the number of generated tokens—by up to 90%—while incurring only a small accuracy drop (less than 2%) on a variety of reasoning-focused benchmarks, thereby restoring net efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that naive use of sparse attention in LLM decoding can be counterproductive for end-to-end efficiency due to lengthened outputs. Effective deployment of sparsity must account for this "Less is Less" effect. Their early-stopping algorithm provides a practical fix, enabling large token savings with minimal accuracy loss and demonstrating that careful control of generation length is essential when applying sparse-attention techniques to real-world LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities across a wide range of complex tasks and are increasingly deployed at scale, placing significant demands on inference efficiency. Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

### [53] [Do LLMs Encode Functional Importance of Reasoning Tokens?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03066)
*Janvijay Singh,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to prune unimportant tokens from LLM reasoning chains while preserving likelihood, and shows that these compact chains are more effective for distillation than heuristic or frontier-model-based compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning improves accuracy but is computationally expensive and makes it hard to see which parts of the reasoning are actually functionally important. Existing shortening methods rely on heuristics or stronger models and do not clarify whether models inherently encode importance for each reasoning token. The authors want a diagnostic, model-internal way to identify and remove redundant reasoning tokens while preserving the model’s behavior.

Method: They propose greedy pruning: a likelihood-based deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal least harms the model’s likelihood under a chosen objective. This produces reasoning chains of controlled length while keeping them as close as possible to the original model distribution. They then use these pruned chains as supervision for student models in a distillation setup, and analyze pruning patterns, including how they relate to attention scores.

Result: Students trained on greedy-pruned reasoning chains outperform a baseline where compression is supervised directly by a frontier model, when compared at the same reasoning lengths. Additionally, they find systematic patterns in which tokens are pruned and show that models’ attention scores can predict the pruning order, indicating that internal attention correlates with token functional importance.

Conclusion: Model likelihood can be used to greedily prune reasoning tokens while largely preserving functional behavior, yielding compact yet informative chains that are especially effective for distillation. The observed correlation between attention and pruning importance suggests that LLMs internally encode a meaningful structure over which reasoning tokens are most functionally relevant to generating correct answers.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex tasks by generating long reasoning chains, achieving higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational cost and reduced ability to isolate functionally relevant reasoning. Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens.

*Jing Xiong,Qi Han,Yunta Hsieh,Hui Shen,Huajian Xin,Chaofan Tao,Chenyang Zhao,Hengyuan Zhang,Taiqiang Wu,Zhen Zhang,Haochen Wang,Zhongwei Wan,Lingpeng Kong,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMFormalizer is a multimodal autoformalization framework that converts natural language and visual physics/math problems into fully grounded formal statements suitable for machine reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoformalization methods mostly handle text-only math and struggle in real-world physics settings, where problems are multimodal and crucial quantities or constraints are implicit in diagrams or the physical setup. There is no unified system that can systematically ground visual entities and physical dimensions while constructing formal propositions that provers or symbolic solvers can use across diverse domains like mechanics, relativity, and quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors introduce MMFormalizer, which performs recursive grounding and formalization over multimodal inputs. It starts from perceptually grounded primitives extracted from images/diagrams and text, then recursively builds higher-level formal propositions by composing axioms and constraints. An adaptive recursive termination mechanism ensures each abstraction step is justified either by direct visual evidence (e.g., object positions, trajectories) or by dimensional/axiomatic grounding (e.g., conservation laws, units). The framework is evaluated on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, derived from several multimodal math/physics datasets, and the produced formalizations are checked for compilation and semantic correctness using downstream tools.

Result: On the PhyX-AF benchmark of 115 multimodal tasks spanning MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, MMFormalizer enables frontier LLMs such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro to achieve the highest compile-time and semantic accuracy among tested configurations. GPT-5 shows particularly strong performance on physical reasoning tasks, while all models find geometry tasks most difficult. The system successfully autoformalizes problems not only from classical mechanics (including Hamiltonian formulations) but also from relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

Conclusion: MMFormalizer establishes a scalable and unified framework for multimodal autoformalization that integrates perception with formal reasoning. By enforcing grounding at each abstraction step, it can reliably transform complex, visually grounded physics and math problems into formal languages usable by machine reasoners, across several key areas of physics. The work represents, to the authors’ knowledge, the first demonstration of a multimodal autoformalization pipeline capable of spanning classical, relativistic, quantum, and thermodynamic domains.

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

### [55] [Grad-ELLM: Gradient-based Explanations for Decoder-only LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03089)
*Xin Huang,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Grad-ELLM is a gradient-based attribution method tailored for decoder-only transformer LLMs that generates faithful token-level heatmaps and outperforms prior attribution techniques, alongside new fairness-aware faithfulness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing input attribution methods for explaining LLM predictions are mostly model-agnostic and not tailored to transformer architectures, which leads to limited faithfulness and less trustworthy explanations of LLM behavior. There is also a lack of evaluation metrics that fairly compare attribution methods while controlling for the information preserved in perturbation-based tests.

Method: The authors design Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution approach specialized for decoder-only transformer LLMs. It computes channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and combines this with spatial importance derived from attention maps. These are aggregated to produce token-level heatmaps at each generation step, without changing the underlying model architecture. Additionally, the authors propose two modified faithfulness metrics, π-Soft-NC and π-Soft-NS, which adapt Soft-NC/NS to control the amount of information retained when perturbing text, enabling fairer comparisons between attribution methods.

Result: Across multiple tasks—sentiment classification, question answering, and open-ended generation—and using different LLMs, Grad-ELLM yields more faithful attributions than baseline methods according to the proposed metrics and existing evaluation criteria. The method successfully generates step-wise heatmaps that better align with influential tokens for the model’s outputs.

Conclusion: Tailoring attribution to transformer internals using gradients and attention, as done in Grad-ELLM, improves the faithfulness of explanations for decoder-only LLMs without requiring architectural changes. The new π-Soft-NC and π-Soft-NS metrics offer more equitable evaluation of attribution methods by controlling perturbation-level information, and experiments validate that Grad-ELLM provides more faithful explanations than alternative approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency and faithfulness. Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $π$-Soft-NC and $π$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods.

### [56] [MedDialogRubrics: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Multi-turn Medical Consultations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03023)
*Lecheng Gong,Weimin Fang,Ting Yang,Dongjie Tao,Chunxiao Guo,Peng Wei,Bo Xie,Jinqun Guan,Zixiao Chen,Fang Shi,Jinjie Gu,Junwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces MedDialogRubrics, a synthetic, rubric-based benchmark to rigorously evaluate multi-turn diagnostic dialogue abilities of medical LLMs, showing current models struggle and need better dialogue management, not just fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical conversational AI benchmarks do not rigorously test information gathering and diagnostic reasoning in multi-turn settings, and often raise privacy concerns when using real patient data. There is a need for a scalable, clinically grounded, and privacy-preserving benchmark that can reveal the true capabilities and limitations of medical LLMs in diagnostic dialogue.

Method: They build MedDialogRubrics, a benchmark of 5,200 synthetic patient cases generated via a multi-agent system that encodes disease knowledge to create realistic records and chief complaints without using real EHRs. A specially designed Patient Agent is restricted to atomic medical facts and guided by a dynamic hallucination-detection and correction mechanism to maintain coherence and clinical plausibility over multi-turn dialogues. They then create over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics via an LLM-based pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines and uses reject sampling to select prioritized, expert-refined “must-ask” rubric items for each case. Finally, they use these rubrics to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art medical LLMs across multiple dimensions of diagnostic dialogue performance.

Result: MedDialogRubrics provides a large, structured synthetic dataset and rubric set that enables fine-grained scoring of information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning. When applied to current state-of-the-art models, the benchmark reveals that these models perform poorly on several key assessment dimensions and systematically miss many “must-ask” items, indicating significant gaps in their diagnostic dialogue abilities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current medical LLMs are far from mastering multi-turn diagnostic dialogue when evaluated with rigorous, guideline-based rubrics. Progress in medical conversational AI will require new dialogue management architectures and better handling of multi-turn reasoning, rather than only incremental fine-tuning of existing base models. MedDialogRubrics is proposed as a foundation for more realistic and clinically meaningful evaluation and development of such systems.

Abstract: Medical conversational AI (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development of safer and more effective medical dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items ("must-ask" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges. Our results indicate that improving medical dialogue will require advances in dialogue management architectures, not just incremental tuning of the base-model.

### [57] [ToxiGAN: Toxic Data Augmentation via LLM-Guided Directional Adversarial Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03121)
*Peiran Li,Jan Fillies,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToxiGAN, a class-aware GAN-based framework that uses LLM-guided semantic ballast and a two-step directional training strategy to generate toxic language augmentations that improve robustness in toxicity classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity classification models suffer from limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and distributional skew, making them brittle and poorly generalizable, especially for minority toxic classes. Existing text augmentation methods, including both traditional approaches and direct LLM-based generation, struggle to generate diverse, class-specific toxic examples without drifting semantically or collapsing to a few patterns. There is a need for a controllable, class-aware augmentation technique that can reliably enrich toxic data while preserving semantic contrast with non-toxic content and improving downstream classifier robustness.

Method: The authors propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework built on generative adversarial networks. ToxiGAN combines adversarial generation of toxic text with semantic guidance from large language models. First, an LLM is used to generate neutral (non-toxic) texts that serve as semantic ballast, representing the non-toxic side of the semantic space. Rather than fixing these exemplars, ToxiGAN dynamically selects neutral samples during training. The generator is then trained with a two-step directional strategy: (1) it learns to produce toxic examples that align with the target toxicity class, and (2) it is explicitly optimized to diverge from the chosen neutral exemplars, enforcing a contrastive direction in semantic space away from neutrality. This helps mitigate mode collapse and semantic drift typical of GAN-based augmentation. The resulting synthetic toxic samples are used to augment the training data for toxicity classifiers.

Result: On four hate speech / toxicity benchmarks, ToxiGAN yields the best average performance compared with both traditional augmentation methods (e.g., paraphrasing, back-translation) and more recent LLM-based augmentation baselines. The improvements are observed on macro-F1 and hate-F1 metrics, indicating better performance particularly on minority toxic classes as well as overall balanced accuracy. Ablation studies show performance drops when removing semantic ballast or the two-step directional training, confirming each component’s contribution. Sensitivity analyses across hyperparameters likewise demonstrate that the proposed design enhances robustness and reduces brittleness of the classifier to data distribution shifts.

Conclusion: ToxiGAN demonstrates that combining adversarial toxic text generation with LLM-based semantic ballast and a directional training regimen leads to more effective, class-specific toxic data augmentation. By explicitly pushing generated toxic samples away from dynamically selected neutral exemplars, the framework mitigates mode collapse and semantic drift while providing stronger contrastive signals for the classifier. The empirical gains across multiple benchmarks, together with ablation and sensitivity analyses, support ToxiGAN as a robust and principled augmentation strategy for toxicity and hate speech classification tasks.

Abstract: Augmenting toxic language data in a controllable and class-specific manner is crucial for improving robustness in toxicity classification, yet remains challenging due to limited supervision and distributional skew. We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.

### [58] [LittiChoQA: Literary Texts in Indic Languages Chosen for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03025)
*Aarya Khandelwal,Ritwik Mishra,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces LittiChoQA, a large long-context literary QA dataset for low-resource Indic languages, and shows performance–efficiency trade-offs for multilingual LLMs under full vs shortened context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs struggle with long-context question answering, especially for low-resource Indic languages where QA resources are scarce. There is a need for a sizable, realistic literary QA benchmark to study long-context modeling and retrieval strategies in these languages.

Method: The authors collect naturally authored literary texts from the open web in multiple Indic languages of the Gangetic plains, then automatically generate over 270K question–answer pairs with a balanced mix of factoid and non-factoid questions. They fine-tune and evaluate several multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA under two conditions: (1) full-context input and (2) shortened context via answer-paragraph selection or vector-based retrieval. They use token-level and semantic-level evaluation metrics and add qualitative analysis of model outputs.

Result: Full-context fine-tuning delivers the best token-level and semantic-level QA scores but is less efficient, while context-shortening methods significantly increase throughput at a modest performance cost. Among the tested models, Krutrim-2 performs best, with a semantic score of 76.1 using full context, 74.9 with answer-paragraph selection, and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval in shortened contexts. Qualitative analysis aligns with these quantitative trends.

Conclusion: LittiChoQA fills an important resource gap for long-context literary QA in Indic languages and enables systematic study of context-length strategies. There exists a measurable performance–efficiency trade-off: full-context processing is most accurate, whereas context-shortening approaches like paragraph selection or vector retrieval offer substantial efficiency gains with only moderate drops in QA quality. Krutrim-2 currently sets a strong baseline on this benchmark.

Abstract: Long-context question answering (QA) over literary texts poses significant challenges for modern large language models, particularly in low-resource languages. We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India. The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput. Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context. While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval. Qualitative evaluations further corroborate these findings.

### [59] [Limited Linguistic Diversity in Embodied AI Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03136)
*Selma Wanna,Agnes Luhtaru,Jonathan Salfity,Ryan Barron,Juston Moore,Cynthia Matuszek,Mitch Pryor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper audits language in popular Vision-Language-Action datasets, finding that instructions are highly repetitive and structurally narrow, and argues for better documentation and broader linguistic coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models depend heavily on language input, but the linguistic properties of the datasets they are trained and evaluated on are largely undocumented. Without understanding what kinds of instructions these datasets contain, it is hard to assess model generalization, choose appropriate datasets, or design better ones. The authors want to fill this gap by systematically characterizing the instruction language in common VLA corpora.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA datasets. They quantify the language of instructions along multiple complementary dimensions: lexical variety (e.g., vocabulary size, word diversity), duplication and overlap (extent of repeated or near-duplicate instructions within and across datasets), semantic similarity (how similar instructions are in meaning, likely via embedding-based metrics), and syntactic complexity (sentence structure variation and complexity, possibly using parse-based metrics). They then compare these metrics across datasets to characterize their linguistic coverage.

Result: The analysis reveals that many VLA datasets rely heavily on repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural and lexical variation. Instruction forms are narrow in distribution, with substantial duplication and overlapping patterns, indicating that the language signal in these datasets is less rich and diverse than one might expect for robust language grounding and generalization.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that current VLA training and evaluation datasets provide a constrained and repetitive set of instruction forms, which may limit linguistic generalization of VLA models. They frame their work as descriptive documentation rather than prescriptive judgment, arguing that such audits should inform more detailed dataset reporting, principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation efforts that explicitly broaden linguistic variety and complexity in future VLA corpora.

Abstract: Language plays a critical role in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet the linguistic characteristics of the datasets used to train and evaluate these systems remain poorly documented. In this work, we present a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA corpora, aiming to characterize what kinds of instructions these datasets actually contain and how much linguistic variety they provide. We quantify instruction language along complementary dimensions-including lexical variety, duplication and overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Our analysis shows that many datasets rely on highly repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural variation, yielding a narrow distribution of instruction forms. We position these findings as descriptive documentation of the language signal available in current VLA training and evaluation data, intended to support more detailed dataset reporting, more principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation strategies that broaden language coverage.

### [60] [Reducing Hallucinations in LLMs via Factuality-Aware Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03027)
*Sindhuja Chaduvula,Ahmed Y. Radwan,Azib Farooq,Yani Ioannou,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces F-DPO, a modification of Direct Preference Optimization that incorporates binary factuality signals to reduce hallucinations while preserving or improving instruction-following quality in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference alignment methods like RLHF and DPO can unintentionally encourage hallucinations because human preference judgments often favor fluent, confident answers even when they are factually wrong. There is a need for a training approach that explicitly incorporates factual correctness into preference optimization, without complex reward models or annotations, to make LLMs more truthful and less hallucination-prone.

Method: F-DPO extends DPO using only binary factuality labels attached to responses. First, it applies a label-flipping transformation to each preference pair so that the preferred response is never less factual than the rejected response, correcting misordered pairs. Second, it introduces a factuality-aware margin in the DPO objective that gives higher weight to preference pairs with clear factuality differences and reduces to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. The authors construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting existing DPO preference pairs with binary factuality indicators and adding synthetic hallucinated variants, then train LLMs with this modified objective.

Result: Across seven open-weight LLMs ranging from 1B to 14B parameters, F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates compared with both the unaligned base models and models trained with standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO lowers the hallucination rate by a factor of five (0.424 to 0.084) and increases factuality scores by about 50% (5.26 to 7.90). On out-of-distribution benchmarks like TruthfulQA, F-DPO also improves performance: for Qwen2.5-14B, MC1 accuracy increases from 0.500 to 0.585 and MC2 accuracy from 0.357 to 0.531.

Conclusion: F-DPO is an effective, simple modification to DPO that directly incorporates binary factuality information into preference optimization, substantially reducing hallucinations and improving factual correctness across multiple LLM sizes and architectures. It generalizes to out-of-distribution truthfulness benchmarks and avoids the complexity of training auxiliary reward models or using fine-grained token-level supervision, making it a practical approach for more reliable, factual LLM alignment.

Abstract: Preference alignment methods such as RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improve instruction following, but they can also reinforce hallucinations when preference judgments reward fluency and confidence over factual correctness. We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531). F-DPO requires no auxiliary reward model, token-level annotations, or multi-stage training.

### [61] [Self-Verification is All You Need To Pass The Japanese Bar Examination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03144)
*Andrew Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build a self-verifying LLM, trained on a dataset that exactly matches the real Japanese bar exam format and scoring, and show it can surpass the official passing score—apparently the first time an LLM passes this exam without changing question or scoring structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with very structured, professional exams like the Japanese bar, where success requires not just legal knowledge but also strict conformity to complex answer formats and joint evaluation of multiple propositions. Prior work often simplifies questions into independent true/false items and evaluates on these decomposed tasks, so it is unclear whether such systems truly have exam-level competence under authentic conditions. The authors aim to close this gap by testing LLMs under the actual format and scale of the Japanese bar exam and by investigating what supervision strategies genuinely help in that setting.

Method: They construct a new dataset that faithfully reproduces the original Japanese bar exam question structures, answer formats, and scoring scheme. On top of this, they train a single LLM with a self-verification mechanism: the model generates answers and then internally checks and refines its own reasoning/outputs for consistency with the required structure. They compare this approach with other strategies, such as multi-agent inference (multiple models collaborating or voting) and methods that rely on decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-judgments (decomposition-based supervision). All methods are evaluated directly on the official exam scale.

Result: The self-verification model surpasses the official passing threshold of the Japanese bar examination when evaluated strictly under the authentic question format and scoring rules. In contrast, alternative strategies like multi-agent reasoning and decomposition-based supervision do not reach comparable performance on the same scale. This constitutes, to the authors’ knowledge, the first case of an LLM passing the Japanese bar exam without modifying its original structure or grading scheme.

Conclusion: Format-faithful supervision—training and evaluating models under the exact structure and scoring of the target exam—is crucial for achieving real exam-level competence in high-stakes professional tests. Consistency-focused self-verification within a single model can outperform more complex multi-agent or decompositional systems when the task demands strict adherence to intricate answer formats and joint proposition evaluation. The work suggests that carefully designed single-model, self-checking approaches are a promising direction for reliable professional reasoning, and it provides a public dataset and codebase to support further research.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on highly professional and structured examinations remains a significant challenge. The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks. Our dataset and codes are publicly available.

### [62] [NorwAI's Large Language Models: Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03034)
*Jon Atle Gulla,Peng Liu,Lemei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents NorLLM, a family of Norwegian- and Scandinavian-focused large language models built on modern Transformer architectures, with extensive pretraining and instruction-tuning, and describes their design, training, deployment, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Norwegian, despite having around five million speakers, is underrepresented in major NLP advances and widely used LLMs. This creates a performance and accessibility gap for Norwegian users and organizations. The authors aim to close this gap by developing high-quality, domain-adaptable LLMs specifically optimized for Norwegian and related Scandinavian languages, and to make them accessible for research and experimentation in the Nordic region.

Method: The authors build a suite of LLMs based on several Transformer architectures (GPT, Mistral, Llama2, Mixtral, Magistral). They either pretrain models from scratch or continue pretraining existing models on large-scale corpora (25B–88.45B tokens), using a tokenizer extended for Norwegian. They apply advanced post-training techniques, including instruction tuning (e.g., using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct) to develop assistant-style and domain-adapted variants. The work also covers design of the tokenizer, fine-tuning strategies, and deployment pipelines.

Result: The resulting NorLLM models exhibit strong performance across various real-world tasks in Norwegian and other Scandinavian languages, particularly in their instruction-tuned variants, which demonstrate robust assistant-style capabilities suitable for interactive applications. The paper documents the full model suite, their training data scale, tokenizer modifications, and the outcomes of evaluations, showing that the models are practical and competitive for Nordic-language use cases.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that NorLLM successfully addresses the underrepresentation of Norwegian in modern LLMs by providing a family of specialized, high-quality models. These models, made openly available to Nordic organizations, companies, and students, enable research and experimental deployment in a variety of interactive and domain-specific scenarios. The report serves as a comprehensive technical reference for their architectures, training, tuning, and evaluation, and positions NorLLM as a key resource for Scandinavian NLP.

Abstract: Norwegian, spoken by approximately five million people, remains underrepresented in many of the most significant breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). To address this gap, the NorLLM team at NorwAI has developed a family of models specifically tailored to Norwegian and other Scandinavian languages, building on diverse Transformer-based architectures such as GPT, Mistral, Llama2, Mixtral and Magistral. These models are either pretrained from scratch or continually pretrained on 25B - 88.45B tokens, using a Norwegian-extended tokenizer and advanced post-training strategies to optimize performance, enhance robustness, and improve adaptability across various real-world tasks. Notably, instruction-tuned variants (e.g., Mistral-7B-Instruct and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct) showcase strong assistant-style capabilities, underscoring their potential for practical deployment in interactive and domain-specific applications. The NorwAI large language models are openly available to Nordic organizations, companies and students for both research and experimental use. This report provides detailed documentation of the model architectures, training data, tokenizer design, fine-tuning strategies, deployment, and evaluations.

### [63] [DIP: Dynamic In-Context Planner For Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03199)
*Yang Li,Han Meng,Chenan Wang,Haipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose Dynamic In-Context Planner (DIP), which dynamically chooses and inserts in-context examples during diffusion language model decoding to cut compute while preserving quality, achieving up to 12.9× speedup vs standard inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models can handle general NLP tasks with in-context examples but suffer from high computational cost as the context length grows because of bidirectional attention. Existing prompting strategies feed all in-context examples upfront, leading to unnecessary context processing at every diffusion step. There is a need for a way to reduce this cost without degrading generation quality.

Method: The authors leverage a property of diffusion generation: unlike autoregressive models, diffusion language models do not require strictly sequential token generation. This allows the context to be adjusted efficiently during the denoising process. Based on this, they design Dynamic In-Context Planner (DIP), which chooses which in-context examples are actually needed at different stages of generation, and dynamically inserts or updates those examples instead of keeping a large static prompt. The planner optimizes context usage on-the-fly, reducing the effective context size processed at each step.

Result: Experiments show that DIP preserves or closely matches the original generation quality of diffusion language models that use full static prompts, while significantly reducing inference time. Quantitatively, DIP attains up to 12.9× speedup compared with standard inference without any optimization and 1.17× speedup over an already optimized baseline using key-value cache for attention.

Conclusion: Dynamic context selection and insertion is well-suited to diffusion language models and can substantially cut inference costs while maintaining output quality. The proposed DIP framework demonstrates that exploiting the non-sequential nature of diffusion generation enables more efficient in-context learning than traditional static prompting or even KV cache-optimized baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for general natural language tasks with in-context examples. However, due to the bidirectional attention mechanism, DLMs incur substantial computational cost as context length increases. This work addresses this issue with a key discovery: unlike the sequential generation in autoregressive language models (ARLMs), the diffusion generation paradigm in DLMs allows \textit{efficient dynamic adjustment of the context} during generation. Building on this insight, we propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{P}lanner (DIP), a context-optimization method that dynamically selects and inserts in-context examples during generation, rather than providing all examples in the prompt upfront. Results show DIP maintains generation quality while achieving up to 12.9$\times$ inference speedup over standard inference and 1.17$\times$ over KV cache-enhanced inference.

### [64] [BaseCal: Unsupervised Confidence Calibration via Base Model Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03042)
*Hexiang Tan,Wanli Yang,Junwei Zhang,Xin Chen,Rui Tang,Du Su,Jingang Wang,Yuanzhuo Wang,Fei Sun,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BaseCal, an unsupervised method to improve the confidence calibration of post-trained LLMs (PoLLMs) by leveraging their better-calibrated base LLMs, significantly reducing Expected Calibration Error without extra labels or model modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-trained LLMs (those after instruction tuning, RLHF, etc.) are widely deployed but tend to be severely overconfident, making their probability scores unreliable for risk-sensitive use. However, their original base models are often much better calibrated. This calibration gap undermines trust and safe deployment. The authors are motivated to exploit the base model’s good calibration to fix the overconfidence of the derived PoLLM without needing costly supervision or intrusive modifications.

Method: They propose BaseCal, with two variants. (1) BaseCal-ReEval: For each PoLLM response, feed that response into the base LLM and use the base model’s average token probabilities as the confidence score, treating the base model as a calibration oracle. (2) BaseCal-Proj: To avoid the extra inference of re-evaluating with the base LLM, they learn a lightweight projection layer that maps the PoLLM’s final hidden states back into the representation space of the base LLM. These projected states are then passed through the base LLM’s output layer to obtain confidence scores that mimic the base model’s calibration. The whole approach is unsupervised and plug-and-play, requiring no human labels and no architectural changes to the LLMs themselves.

Result: Across five datasets and three LLM families, BaseCal substantially improves calibration of PoLLMs. It reduces Expected Calibration Error by an average of 42.90% compared to the best existing unsupervised calibration baselines, while maintaining the PoLLMs’ original predictions and avoiding additional labels or major computational overhead (especially with the projection variant).

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the well-calibrated nature of base LLMs can be effectively leveraged to repair the overconfidence of post-trained variants. BaseCal offers a practical, unsupervised, and model-agnostic way to obtain reliable confidence estimates from PoLLMs, significantly enhancing their trustworthiness without retraining or labeled data.

Abstract: Reliable confidence is essential for trusting the outputs of LLMs, yet widely deployed post-trained LLMs (PoLLMs) typically compromise this trust with severe overconfidence. In contrast, we observe that their corresponding base LLMs often remain well-calibrated. This naturally motivates us to calibrate PoLLM confidence using the base LLM as a reference. This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses. Notably, BaseCal is an unsupervised, plug-and-play solution that operates without human labels or LLM modifications. Experiments across five datasets and three LLM families demonstrate the effectiveness of BaseCal, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by an average of 42.90\% compared to the best unsupervised baselines.

### [65] [UltraLogic: Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Large-Scale Data Synthesis and Bipolar Float Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03205)
*Yile Liu,Yixian Liu,Zongwei Li,Yufei Huang,Xinhua Feng,Zhichao Hu,Jinglu Hu,Jianfeng Yan,Fengzong Lian,Yuhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UltraLogic is a framework for generating large-scale, difficulty-calibrated reasoning data and a new graded reward scheme (BFR) that together improve LLM logical reasoning via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs still struggle with complex, multi-step general-purpose reasoning that requires logic, planning, and verification. Existing approaches like RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have worked in narrow domains but lack scalable, diverse, and well-calibrated datasets for broad reasoning skills. Moreover, standard binary rewards in RL create sparsity and optimization issues, limiting effective training.

Method: The authors introduce UltraLogic, which separates the logical structure of problems from their natural language wording by using a code-based solving pipeline. This allows them to automatically generate high-quality reasoning tasks spanning hundreds of task types and ten difficulty levels via an automated calibration pipeline. They also design a Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism that assigns graded, possibly negative, rewards based on the degree of logical correctness, mitigating reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap. Training strategies include leveraging task diversity and matching task difficulty to model capability during RL.

Result: Experiments show that increasing the diversity of task types leads to the largest gains in reasoning performance of LLMs. In addition, using BFR together with difficulty matching significantly boosts training efficiency and helps models converge toward more globally optimal logical reasoning policies, outperforming setups with binary rewards or less diverse data.

Conclusion: UltraLogic provides an automated, scalable way to generate diverse, difficulty-calibrated reasoning data and a more informative reward signal (BFR) for RL-based training of LLMs. These components together alleviate key bottlenecks in current reasoning training pipelines, indicating that broad task diversity and graded, bipolar rewards are crucial for advancing general-purpose logical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing , complex general-purpose reasoning requiring multi-step logic, planning, and verification remains a critical bottleneck. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.

### [66] [Multi-RADS Synthetic Radiology Report Dataset and Head-to-Head Benchmarking of 41 Open-Weight and Proprietary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03232)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RXL-RADSet, a synthetic, radiologist-verified benchmark to evaluate how well language models can automatically assign multiple radiology Reporting and Data System (RADS) categories from narrative reports, showing that large open-weight small language models can nearly match a proprietary model when given guided prompts, but still struggle with more complex RADS schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated assignment of RADS categories (like BI-RADS, LI-RADS, etc.) from free-text radiology reports is valuable for consistent risk communication, research, and downstream clinical tools, but is hard because guidelines are complex, label formats are constrained, and there is a lack of standardized, cross-RADS benchmarks—especially ones suitable for systematically comparing different model sizes and architectures. The authors aim to fill this gap and to understand how well open-weight language models perform relative to a strong proprietary model, and how prompting strategies affect performance.

Method: The authors constructed RXL-RADSet, a dataset of 1,600 synthetic radiology reports covering 10 different RADS frameworks and multiple imaging modalities. Reports were generated using large language models guided by scenario plans and varied, simulated radiologist reporting styles, then passed through a two-stage verification by radiologists to ensure realism and correctness. They then evaluated 41 quantized open-weight small language models from 12 model families (ranging from 0.135B to 32B parameters) plus a proprietary GPT-5.2 model using a fixed guided prompt to produce RADS assignments. They measured output validity (i.e., whether outputs followed the required format and scheme) and accuracy (correctness of the assigned RADS categories), and ran a secondary comparison of guided versus zero-shot prompting.

Result: With guided prompting, the proprietary GPT-5.2 model achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy over 1,600 predictions. Across 65,600 predictions, the pooled open-weight SLMs achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy overall. The best-performing open-weight models in the 20–32B parameter range reached around 99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy, narrowing the gap with GPT-5.2. Performance increased with model size, with a notable improvement between models smaller than 1B and those 10B parameters or larger. Accuracy declined for more complex RADS schemes, primarily due to misclassification rather than invalid formatting. Guided prompting substantially improved both validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot prompting.

Conclusion: RXL-RADSet serves as a radiologist-verified benchmark for evaluating multi-RADS classification from narrative radiology reports. The study shows that large open-weight SLMs in the 20–32B range can nearly match a strong proprietary model’s performance for RADS assignment when guided prompts are used, achieving very high validity and competitive accuracy. However, a performance gap remains, particularly for more complex RADS frameworks, highlighting ongoing challenges in reliably automating structured risk communication from unstructured radiology text and underscoring the importance of both model scale and careful prompt design.

Abstract: Background: Reporting and Data Systems (RADS) standardize radiology risk communication but automated RADS assignment from narrative reports is challenging because of guideline complexity, output-format constraints, and limited benchmarking across RADS frameworks and model sizes. Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes.

### [67] [Temporal Graph Network: Hallucination Detection in Multi-Turn Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03051)
*Vidhi Rathore,Sambu Aneesh,Himanshu Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose a graph-based, context-aware method to detect hallucinations in multi-turn dialogues by modeling conversations as temporal graphs and using attention-based pooling plus classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational AI systems often hallucinate, especially across multiple turns where context shifts and contradictions appear. Existing hallucination detection methods struggle to reason over whole dialogues and track entity-level and temporal consistency. The authors aim to better capture dialogue context and relationships between turns to improve hallucination detection performance and interpretability.

Method: Represent each conversation as a temporal graph where each turn is a node encoded by a sentence transformer. Add two types of edges: shared-entity edges linking turns that mention the same entities, and temporal edges linking consecutive turns. Apply message-passing over this graph to update node embeddings, enabling information flow across related turns. Use attention pooling to aggregate context-aware node embeddings into a single dialogue-level vector, then feed this into a classifier to predict presence and type of hallucinations. Use attention weights for interpretability of the model’s decisions.

Result: The proposed graph-based framework achieves slightly better performance than existing hallucination detection methods on dialogue-level tasks. Attention weights provide insight into which turns most influenced the classification decisions.

Conclusion: Modeling dialogues as temporal graphs with entity and temporal connectivity, combined with message-passing and attention pooling, is a viable approach for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. It yields modest performance improvements over baselines and offers some interpretability via attention, and the implementation is publicly released for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Hallucinations can be produced by conversational AI systems, particularly in multi-turn conversations where context changes and contradictions may eventually surface. By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

### [68] [Detecting Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Semantic-level Internal Reasoning Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03052)
*Jianpeng Hu,Yanzeng Li,Jialun Zhong,Wenfa Qi,Lei Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose a method that builds a semantic-level internal reasoning graph from an LLM’s attribution signals to better detect faithfulness hallucinations in RAG outputs, outperforming prior methods on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems reduce factual hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents, but they still produce faithfulness hallucinations—cases where the model’s reasoning or use of evidence is unfaithful to the source, even if some facts look correct. Existing detectors either ignore the model’s internal reasoning process or only use it in a very coarse way, making it hard for discriminators to learn reliable signals. The authors want a more faithful, fine-grained representation of how the LLM internally reasons so that hallucinations can be detected more accurately.

Method: They generalize layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) from the token level to the semantic level. Using attribution vectors from the LLM, they build an internal reasoning graph where nodes represent semantic units and edges encode dependency/attribution relations, giving a semantic-level view of reasoning dependencies. On top of this graph, they design a general detection framework using a small pre-trained language model as the discriminator. This smaller model is trained to use the reasoning dependencies captured in the graph to distinguish faithful from hallucinated outputs. The framework also uses a tunable threshold to dynamically control the pass rate of correct samples (precision–recall trade-off).

Result: On the RAGTruth and Dolly-15k benchmarks, the proposed method achieves better overall hallucination-detection performance than state-of-the-art baselines. Quantitative evaluations show improved metrics (e.g., accuracy or F1; exact numbers not given in the abstract), indicating that incorporating semantic-level reasoning graphs provides more discriminative signals for faithfulness hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Modeling an LLM’s internal reasoning at the semantic level via an internal reasoning graph derived from extended LRP significantly improves the detection of faithfulness hallucinations in RAG systems. A small auxiliary language model can effectively exploit these reasoning dependencies, and a threshold-based mechanism can flexibly control acceptance of correct outputs. The approach is general and outperforms existing methods on standard datasets, suggesting that fine-grained semantic reasoning traces are valuable for reliable hallucination detection.

Abstract: The Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on Large language model (LLM) has made significant progress. It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better overall performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on RAGTruth and Dolly-15k.

### [69] [Learning to Diagnose and Correct Moral Errors: Towards Enhancing Moral Sensitivity in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03079)
*Bocheng Chen,Han Zi,Xi Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Johnson,Guangliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes pragmatic inference methods to improve moral sensitivity in large language models (LLMs), enabling them to better detect morally benign/hazardous inputs and correct moral errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moral sensitivity—recognizing when a situation has moral stakes—is crucial for regulating human behavior. While many works align LLMs with human moral values (e.g., through RLHF or safety tuning), it remains difficult to make LLMs reliably and consistently sensitive to moral nuances in diverse, complex language inputs. The authors aim to fill this gap by explicitly enhancing LLMs’ ability to detect moral salience and hazards rather than just enforcing static rules or post-hoc filters.

Method: They introduce two pragmatic inference methods for LLMs. Instead of treating moral discourse as a collection of highly varied surface forms, these methods focus on the underlying inferential loads—what is implied, presupposed, or entailed in an utterance. The LLM is guided to (1) pragmatically diagnose whether an input is morally benign or hazardous and (2) pragmatically revise or correct outputs that contain moral errors. The key is a unified, principled inference procedure that can be applied across different moral scenarios and linguistic forms by reasoning about the pragmatic implications rather than superficial wording.

Result: Experiments on representative morality-related benchmarks show that these pragmatic inference methods significantly improve LLMs’ ability to (a) detect morally hazardous vs. benign content and (b) correct their own morally problematic outputs. The approach yields strong and competitive performance compared with existing alignment or safety techniques.

Conclusion: Grounding LLM moral reasoning in pragmatic inference over inferential loads provides an effective and general way to enhance moral sensitivity. The proposed methods unify diverse moral discourses under a common inference framework and empirically improve performance on morality benchmarks, suggesting a promising direction for building safer, more morally aware LLMs.

Abstract: Moral sensitivity is fundamental to human moral competence, as it guides individuals in regulating everyday behavior. Although many approaches seek to align large language models (LLMs) with human moral values, how to enable them morally sensitive has been extremely challenging. In this paper, we take a step toward answering the question: how can we enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs? Specifically, we propose two pragmatic inference methods that faciliate LLMs to diagnose morally benign and hazardous input and correct moral errors, whereby enhancing LLMs' moral sensitivity. A central strength of our pragmatic inference methods is their unified perspective: instead of modeling moral discourses across semantically diverse and complex surface forms, they offer a principled perspective for designing pragmatic inference procedures grounded in their inferential loads. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our pragmatic methods can enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs and achieves strong performance on representative morality-relevant benchmarks.

### [70] [Discovering and Causally Validating Emotion-Sensitive Neurons in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03115)
*Xiutian Zhao,Björn Schuller,Berrak Sisman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uncovers and manipulates individual neurons in large audio‑language models that specifically encode emotions, showing they causally drive emotion recognition and can be used for fine‑grained control of affective behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although emotions are crucial in spoken communication and LALMs perform well on emotional tasks, we lack a mechanistic, neuron-level understanding of how these models internally represent and use emotional information. Existing work has focused mostly on text-only models or non-causal correlation-based analyses, leaving a gap in interpretability and controllability for audio-language systems handling affective speech.

Method: The authors conduct a neuron-level interpretability study on three open-source LALMs (Qwen2.5‑Omni, Kimi‑Audio, Audio Flamingo 3). They identify emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) using several selector strategies (frequency, entropy, magnitude, and contrast-based criteria) on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. They then apply inference-time interventions—targeted neuron ablations and gain-based amplifications—while measuring resulting changes in emotion classification performance. They also analyze the layer-wise distribution and cross-dataset transfer of the identified ESNs.

Result: They find that neurons selected as emotion-sensitive for a specific emotion form a consistent, causal signature across models: ablating these neurons disproportionately harms recognition of their corresponding emotion, while leaving other emotion classes relatively intact; amplifying them biases predictions toward the target emotion. These effects appear even with relatively little data used for neuron identification and increase smoothly with intervention strength. ESNs are found to be clustered in certain layers rather than uniformly distributed and show partial generalization across different emotion datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides causal evidence that LALMs contain specialized neurons for distinct emotions and that manipulating these neurons can steer the model’s affective outputs. This yields a mechanistic, neuron-level account of emotion decisions in audio-language models and demonstrates that targeted neuron interventions are a practical tool for interpretable and controllable emotion handling in such systems.

Abstract: Emotion is a central dimension of spoken communication, yet, we still lack a mechanistic account of how modern large audio-language models (LALMs) encode it internally. We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion. These effects arise with modest identification data and scale systematically with intervention strength. We further observe that ESNs exhibit non-uniform layer-wise clustering with partial cross-dataset transfer. Taken together, our results offer a causal, neuron-level account of emotion decisions in LALMs and highlight targeted neuron interventions as an actionable handle for controllable affective behaviors.

### [71] [The Anatomy of Conversational Scams: A Topic-Based Red Teaming Analysis of Multi-Turn Interactions in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03134)
*Xiangzhe Yuan,Zhenhao Zhang,Haoming Tang,Siying Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models behave in multi-turn scam conversations, revealing new interactional safety risks not captured by single-turn evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluations mostly examine single-turn prompts and responses, which miss how risks emerge and escalate over extended dialogues where LLMs act as persuasive agents. There is a growing concern that multi-turn conversational scams—where an attacker patiently manipulates a victim over time—pose distinct risks that require systematic study.

Method: The authors build a controlled LLM-to-LLM simulation framework where one LLM plays an attacker and another plays a defender (or victim) across multi-turn scam scenarios. They test eight state-of-the-art models in both English and Chinese. They then analyze the resulting dialogues, qualitatively annotating attacker strategies, defensive responses, and interactional failure modes.

Result: They find that scam conversations tend to follow recurrent escalation patterns, where attackers gradually intensify persuasion or deception. Defensive behaviors often rely on verification (checking information, asking for proof) and delay tactics (stalling, deferring action). Many failures in interaction—such as broken role adherence or abrupt conversation breakdown—are linked to safety guardrails triggering and to models losing track of their assigned roles.

Conclusion: Multi-turn interactional safety is a distinct and critical aspect of LLM behavior that cannot be adequately assessed with single-turn evaluations. Future safety work should explicitly consider dynamic, multi-step interactions, including patterns of escalation, defense, and failure, especially for scenarios like conversational scams.

Abstract: As LLMs gain persuasive agentic capabilities through extended dialogues, they introduce novel risks in multi-turn conversational scams that single-turn safety evaluations fail to capture. We systematically study these risks using a controlled LLM-to-LLM simulation framework across multi-turn scam scenarios. Evaluating eight state-of-the-art models in English and Chinese, we analyze dialogue outcomes and qualitatively annotate attacker strategies, defensive responses, and failure modes. Results reveal that scam interactions follow recurrent escalation patterns, while defenses employ verification and delay mechanisms. Furthermore, interactional failures frequently stem from safety guardrail activation and role instability. Our findings highlight multi-turn interactional safety as a critical, distinct dimension of LLM behavior.

### [72] [Improving Indigenous Language Machine Translation with Synthetic Data and Language-Specific Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03135)
*Aashish Dhawan,Christopher Driggers-Ellis,Christan Grant,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves neural machine translation for low-resource indigenous American languages by augmenting limited parallel data with synthetic sentence pairs from a strong multilingual model and applying language-specific preprocessing, leading to better chrF++ scores but revealing limits for very agglutinative languages like Aymara.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indigenous languages in the Americas suffer from very limited parallel corpora, which hampers the performance of neural machine translation systems. Curating high-quality data is expensive and slow, and generic NMT models underperform for these languages. The authors aim to investigate whether synthetic parallel data generated from a high-capacity multilingual model, combined with language-specific preprocessing, can effectively improve translation quality for these low-resource, often agglutinative, languages.

Method: 1) Start with curated parallel datasets for several indigenous American languages paired with Spanish. 2) Use a high-capacity multilingual translation model to generate synthetic parallel sentence pairs, augmenting the original datasets. 3) Fine-tune a multilingual mBART model on both curated-only data and curated-plus-synthetic data. 4) Apply language-specific preprocessing such as orthographic normalization and noise-aware filtering to clean and standardize the corpora. 5) Evaluate translation performance using chrF++, the main metric in AmericasNLP tasks for agglutinative languages. 6) Run experiments on Guarani–Spanish, Quechua–Spanish, and diagnostic experiments on Aymara to assess effectiveness and limitations.

Result: For Guarani–Spanish and Quechua–Spanish translation, adding synthetic sentence pairs to the curated data consistently improves chrF++ scores compared to training only on curated data. The language-specific preprocessing (orthographic normalization and noise-aware filtering) helps reduce corpus artifacts and contributes to better translation quality. However, results on Aymara show that these generic preprocessing and augmentation techniques are less effective or may even be inadequate for languages with very high agglutination, exposing constraints of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation using a strong multilingual model, combined with targeted language-specific preprocessing, is an effective way to improve NMT performance for some low-resource indigenous American languages such as Guarani and Quechua. Nonetheless, the approach does not universally transfer, as diagnostic experiments on Aymara suggest that highly agglutinative languages may require more specialized or tailored methods beyond generic preprocessing and synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Low-resource indigenous languages often lack the parallel corpora required for effective neural machine translation (NMT). Synthetic data generation offers a practical strategy for mitigating this limitation in data-scarce settings. In this work, we augment curated parallel datasets for indigenous languages of the Americas with synthetic sentence pairs generated using a high-capacity multilingual translation model. We fine-tune a multilingual mBART model on curated-only and synthetically augmented data and evaluate translation quality using chrF++, the primary metric used in recent AmericasNLP shared tasks for agglutinative languages.
  We further apply language-specific preprocessing, including orthographic normalization and noise-aware filtering, to reduce corpus artifacts. Experiments on Guarani--Spanish and Quechua--Spanish translation show consistent chrF++ improvements from synthetic data augmentation, while diagnostic experiments on Aymara highlight the limitations of generic preprocessing for highly agglutinative languages.

### [73] [Decoupling the Effect of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: A Human Label Variation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03154)
*Beiduo Chen,Tiancheng Hu,Caiqi Zhang,Robert Litschko,Anna Korhonen,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how reasoning-tuned LLMs with long Chain-of-Thought behave on tasks where multiple human answers are valid and we care about the full label distribution, not a single correct answer. It finds that CoT mainly determines the final chosen answer, while the model’s intrinsic priors shape the probability distribution over options, so CoT is a strong decision-maker but a weak distribution calibrator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most work on reasoning-tuned LLMs and long Chain-of-Thought focuses on improving accuracy on single-label tasks, assuming there is one correct answer. However, real human annotations often show label variation and ambiguity, where what matters is modeling the whole distribution of human responses. It is unclear whether CoT-based reasoning helps LLMs capture such probabilistic ambiguity or just pushes them more confidently toward one option. The paper aims to disentangle the effects of CoT reasoning text from the model’s built-in priors on distribution-based tasks.

Method: The authors design distribution-based tasks that capture Human Label Variation, where multiple options have non-zero probabilities. They run systematic disentanglement experiments called Cross-CoT: using reasoning text (Chain-of-Thought) from one setting or sample and combining it with another model’s or sample’s predictive distribution to separate the influence of reasoning content from intrinsic model priors. They analyze final accuracy, distributional ranking, and step-wise effects across the CoT steps to see how each component contributes to modeling the label distribution.

Result: They find evidence of a "decoupled mechanism" in reasoning-tuned LLMs. Long CoT substantially improves alignment with the target label distribution overall, but the mechanism is split: final accuracy (which option is picked as top-1) is almost entirely determined by the content of the CoT, accounting for about 99% of the variance in accuracy, while the ranking and structure of probabilities over options are dominated by the model’s intrinsic priors, contributing over 80% of the variance in distributional ranking. Step-wise analysis shows CoT’s effect on accuracy steadily increases throughout the reasoning process, but the underlying distributional shape remains mostly driven by priors.

Conclusion: Long Chain-of-Thought acts as a decisive decision-maker that selects the top answer, improving accuracy on single-answer tasks, but it largely fails as a fine-grained calibrator of probability distributions in ambiguous, multi-label settings. Distributional structure and ranking over options remain governed by the model’s intrinsic priors rather than the reasoning steps. This implies that simply extending or improving CoT may not be sufficient for better modeling of human label variation; additional methods are needed for true distributional calibration.

Abstract: Reasoning-tuned LLMs utilizing long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) excel at single-answer tasks, yet their ability to model Human Label Variation--which requires capturing probabilistic ambiguity rather than resolving it--remains underexplored. We investigate this through systematic disentanglement experiments on distribution-based tasks, employing Cross-CoT experiments to isolate the effect of reasoning text from intrinsic model priors. We observe a distinct "decoupled mechanism": while CoT improves distributional alignment, final accuracy is dictated by CoT content (99% variance contribution), whereas distributional ranking is governed by model priors (over 80%). Step-wise analysis further shows that while CoT's influence on accuracy grows monotonically during the reasoning process, distributional structure is largely determined by LLM's intrinsic priors. These findings suggest that long CoT serves as a decisive LLM decision-maker for the top option but fails to function as a granular distribution calibrator for ambiguous tasks.

### [74] [WebAnchor: Anchoring Agent Planning to Stabilize Long-Horizon Web Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03164)
*Yu Xinmiao,Zhang Liwen,Feng Xiaocheng,Jiang Yong,Qin Bing,Xie Pengjun,Zhou Jingren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that improves long-horizon web reasoning of LLM-based agents by focusing on optimizing the first planning step and then aligning execution with that plan, leading to better success rates and tool efficiency across multiple web-browsing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLM-based agents show strong web information-seeking abilities, their performance on long-horizon tasks is limited by poor planning, especially at the beginning of reasoning. Existing RL methods treat all steps in a trajectory equally and use uniformly distributed rewards, ignoring the disproportionately large influence of the first reasoning step (the "plan anchor") on downstream decisions and overall task success. The authors are motivated to explicitly model and optimize this critical first-step planning to unlock more effective long-horizon strategies in web-based tasks.

Method: The authors propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework tailored for web agents. First, they identify the "plan anchor" phenomenon, where the initial reasoning step heavily affects the subsequent trajectory. In Stage 1 of Anchor-GRPO, they decouple planning from execution and optimize the first-step plan itself, guided by fine-grained rubrics generated from self-play and refined through human calibration. This stage focuses on learning better initial strategies. In Stage 2, they train the agent to execute actions that remain aligned with the optimized initial plan. This is done using sparse rewards that evaluate how well the execution follows the plan and achieves the final goal, promoting stable and efficient tool usage (e.g., browsing actions) instead of uniformly rewarding every step.

Result: Anchor-GRPO is evaluated on four web reasoning and browsing benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch, using LLMs ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. Across all tested settings, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and a variant called First-step GRPO in both task success (pass@1) and efficiency of tool usage (fewer or more effective interactions). The best model, WebAnchor-30B, achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% pass@1 on GAIA, representing substantial gains over baselines. The method also shows good scalability: larger models and longer context windows further increase accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the "plan anchor" effect is a key limiting factor in long-horizon web reasoning for LLM agents and that standard RL training underestimates the importance of the initial reasoning step. By explicitly separating and optimizing planning and execution, Anchor-GRPO significantly improves success rates and tool efficiency on challenging web benchmarks. The approach scales well with model size and context length, suggesting that future web agents can be made more capable and reliable by focusing RL optimization on the earliest planning steps and then aligning downstream behavior to these high-quality plans.

Abstract: Large Language Model(LLM)-based agents have shown strong capabilities in web information seeking, with reinforcement learning (RL) becoming a key optimization paradigm. However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA. Anchor-GRPO also demonstrates strong scalability, getting higher accuracy as model size and context length increase.

### [75] [Can Embedding Similarity Predict Cross-Lingual Transfer? A Systematic Study on African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03168)
*Tewodros Kederalah Idris,Prasenjit Mitra,Roald Eiselen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They study how well different embedding-based similarity metrics can predict which source language will transfer best to low-resource African languages, finding some metrics work well but only when evaluated per model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Choosing good source languages is crucial for cross-lingual transfer to low-resource African languages, but current practice lacks principled, quantitative guidance and may rely on ad-hoc choices or typological resources not tailored to modern embedding-based models.

Method: They run 816 cross-lingual transfer experiments covering three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual language models, and 12 African languages from four language families. For each pair of languages, they compute five embedding similarity metrics and measure how well these metrics correlate with actual transfer performance, comparing against URIEL linguistic typology. They also analyze correlations per model versus pooled across models to study Simpson’s paradox effects.

Result: Cosine gap and retrieval-based embedding similarity metrics such as precision-at-1 (P@1) and CSLS correlate moderately well (Spearman ρ≈0.4–0.6) with cross-lingual transfer performance, whereas CKA has almost no predictive power (ρ≈0.1). When data from different models is pooled, correlation signs can flip due to Simpson’s Paradox, masking the true per-model relationships. Overall, embedding-based metrics predict transfer success about as well as URIEL typological similarity.

Conclusion: Embedding similarity metrics, especially cosine gap and retrieval-based measures, can serve as practical tools for selecting source languages for cross-lingual transfer to African languages, but must be applied and validated on a per-model basis to avoid misleading effects from Simpson’s Paradox. Model-specific analysis is therefore essential, and embedding-based approaches offer a competitive alternative to typology-based methods for guiding source language selection.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer is essential for building NLP systems for low-resource African languages, but practitioners lack reliable methods for selecting source languages. We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($ρ= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($ρ\approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model. Embedding metrics achieve comparable predictive power to URIEL linguistic typology. Our results provide concrete guidance for source language selection and highlight the importance of model-specific analysis.

### [76] [Maximizing Local Entropy Where It Matters: Prefix-Aware Localized LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03190)
*Naixin Zhai,Pengyang Shao,Binbin Zheng,Fei Shen,Long Bai,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose PALU, a localized machine unlearning method for LLMs that only targets the sensitive prefix and top-k logits, improving forgetting while preserving general utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods for LLMs enforce uncertainty over the entire token sequence and the full vocabulary, which causes unnecessary degradation of model utility and wastes optimization on content-irrelevant regions. There is a need for an approach that can forget specific sensitive knowledge more surgically without harming overall performance.

Method: PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning) introduces a local entropy maximization objective applied selectively in two dimensions: (1) temporal – it focuses on the sensitive prefix tokens that causally drive the undesired continuation, and (2) vocabulary – it flattens only the top-k logits corresponding to the most probable tokens, rather than the entire vocabulary. By targeting these local regions, PALU aims to break the causal link from sensitive prompts to harmful continuations while limiting changes elsewhere in the model.

Result: Experiments show that PALU more effectively removes or suppresses the targeted sensitive behavior while better preserving general task performance compared to state-of-the-art unlearning baselines, demonstrating higher forgetting efficacy and less collateral utility loss.

Conclusion: Localizing the unlearning objective to sensitive prefixes and the top-k logits is sufficient to break the causal generation chain for undesired content and to induce uncertainty where it matters most. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary optimization across the full model and vocabulary, achieving more efficient and utility-preserving machine unlearning for LLMs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to forget sensitive knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining general utility. However, existing approaches typically treat all tokens in a response indiscriminately and enforce uncertainty over the entire vocabulary. This global treatment results in unnecessary utility degradation and extends optimization to content-agnostic regions. To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace. These findings allow PALU to avoid redundant optimization across the full vocabulary and parameter space while minimizing collateral damage to general model performance. Extensive experiments validate that PALU achieves superior forgetting efficacy and utility preservation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### [77] [MemRL: Self-Evolving Agents via Runtime Reinforcement Learning on Episodic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03192)
*Shengtao Zhang,Jiaqian Wang,Ruiwen Zhou,Junwei Liao,Yuchen Feng,Weinan Zhang,Ying Wen,Zhiyu Li,Feiyu Xiong,Yutao Qi,Bo Tang,Muning Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemRL is a framework that lets LLM agents improve at runtime by learning which past experiences are useful, using reinforcement learning over an episodic memory instead of updating model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are strong reasoners but lack human-like self-evolution: fine-tuning is costly and risks catastrophic forgetting, and current memory-based methods mainly use static semantic similarity, which often retrieves irrelevant or noisy past experiences. The authors want a way for agents to improve continuously during use, selectively reusing past trajectories without changing model parameters.

Method: They introduce MemRL, which treats the LLM as a frozen, stable reasoner and augments it with a plastic episodic memory trained via non-parametric reinforcement learning. MemRL stores past episodes and uses a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism: first, semantic retrieval to get candidate memories; second, a learned Q-value–based selection that ranks candidates by their learned utility. Q-values for memories are updated from environmental feedback in a trial-and-error RL loop, so the system gradually learns which strategies and experiences are actually useful for new tasks.

Result: On multiple benchmarks—HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench—MemRL achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art baselines that either fine-tune or use more naive memory mechanisms. Analysis experiments show it reduces noisy retrieval and improves task success rates over time.

Conclusion: MemRL offers a practical approach to continuous, in-deployment improvement for LLM-based agents without any weight updates, by resolving the stability–plasticity trade-off: the base LLM remains stable while the episodic memory is adaptively updated using reinforcement learning to favor high-utility experiences and suppress similar but unhelpful ones.

Abstract: The hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to master new skills through Constructive Episodic Simulation-retrieving past experiences to synthesize solutions for novel tasks. While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis experiments confirm that MemRL effectively reconciles the stability-plasticity dilemma, enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates.

### [78] [X-MuTeST: A Multilingual Benchmark for Explainable Hate Speech Detection and A Novel LLM-consulted Explanation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03194)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Sai Kartheek Reddy Kasu,Shashivardhan Reddy Koppula,Sai Rithwik Reddy Chirra,Shwetank Shekhar Singh,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-MuTeST, an explainability-guided multilingual hate speech detection framework that improves both accuracy and interpretability, especially for Hindi and Telugu, using human rationales and a novel explanation method combining LLM reasoning with n-gram perturbation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection models on social media struggle with both accurate classification and clear, faithful explanations, particularly in under-resourced Indic languages like Hindi and Telugu where datasets and rationale annotations are scarce. The authors aim to address this gap by building models and resources that are both high-performing and explainable across multiple languages.

Method: The authors propose X-MuTeST, which integrates: (1) high-level natural language explanations from large language models; (2) a perturbation-based explainability method that measures changes in prediction probabilities when unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams are removed/used, generating importance scores; and (3) human-annotated token-level rationales used during training to guide and refine model attention. Explanations are formed by taking the union of LLM-based rationales and perturbation-based rationales, and these are incorporated into an attention-enhancement training framework. Models are evaluated on English, Hindi, and Telugu datasets with token-level rationale annotations.

Result: Using human rationales in training improves both hate speech classification accuracy and alignment of model explanations with human reasoning. Further gains are achieved when human rationales are combined with the proposed X-MuTeST explainability method to specifically refine attention. The framework yields better performance on Plausibility metrics (Token-F1, IOU-F1) and Faithfulness metrics (Comprehensiveness, Sufficiency) compared to baselines, across English, Hindi, and Telugu.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that explainability-guided training with human rationales and perturbation-based explanations can simultaneously boost accuracy and interpretability in hate speech detection, and that this approach generalizes to under-resourced Indic languages. The released multilingual dataset with token-level rationale annotations and open-source code provides a valuable benchmark and toolset for future research on explainable hate speech detection in diverse linguistic settings.

Abstract: Hate speech detection on social media faces challenges in both accuracy and explainability, especially for underexplored Indic languages. We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts. Our dataset includes token-level rationale annotations for 6,004 Hindi, 4,492 Telugu, and 6,334 English samples. Data and code are available on https://github.com/ziarehman30/X-MuTeST

### [79] [MalruleLib: Large-Scale Executable Misconception Reasoning with Step Traces for Modeling Student Thinking in Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03217)
*Xinghe Chen,Naiming Liu,Shashank Sonkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents MalruleLib, a framework that turns documented math misconceptions into executable procedures to study and improve how models infer and predict student errors across problem formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often make consistent, systematic mistakes in math by following incorrect but internally coherent procedures (malrules). To build effective educational AI that can diagnose and respond to these misconceptions, we need structured, scalable ways to represent, simulate, and evaluate reasoning based on such malrules. Existing models do well on standard problem solving but struggle to infer a student's underlying misconception and generalize that inference across differently worded or formatted problems.

Method: The authors construct MalruleLib, a library that encodes 101 documented mathematical misconceptions (malrules) as executable procedures, grounded in 67 learning-science and math-education sources. They design 498 parameterized problem templates and generate dual-path, step-by-step traces: one for correct reasoning and one for reasoning that is consistent with each malrule. They formalize Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA), a task where a model must infer a misconception from a single worked erroneous example and then predict the student's next answer on a rephrased (cross-template) problem. They evaluate nine language models (4B–120B parameters) on both standard problem solving and this new MRA setting, including variants with and without access to student step traces.

Result: MalruleLib can generate over one million synthetic instances because the malrules are executable and the templates are parameterizable. Across nine language models, performance on ordinary direct problem solving is about 66% accuracy, but it drops to about 40% when doing cross-template misconception prediction in the MRA setting. They observe 10–21% degradation in accuracy when moving to cross-template generalization, showing that models struggle to transfer inferred misconceptions across formats. Providing detailed student step traces improves prediction performance by 3–15%, indicating that richer process information helps models reason about underlying malrules.

Conclusion: MalruleLib provides scalable infrastructure for modeling student procedures and misconceptions in mathematics. The results demonstrate that current language models have substantial difficulty inferring and generalizing student misconceptions across differently phrased problems, but that access to step-wise reasoning traces mitigates this gap. The framework enables controlled evaluation and supervision for educational AI systems aimed at diagnosing and addressing underlying misconceptions rather than just final answers, supporting more targeted and robust feedback across problem contexts.

Abstract: Student mistakes in mathematics are often systematic: a learner applies a coherent but wrong procedure and repeats it across contexts. We introduce MalruleLib, a learning-science-grounded framework that translates documented misconceptions into executable procedures, drawing on 67 learning-science and mathematics education sources, and generates step-by-step traces of malrule-consistent student work. We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%. We release MalruleLib as infrastructure for educational AI that models student procedures across contexts, enabling diagnosis and feedback that targets the underlying misconception.

### [80] [STReasoner: Empowering LLMs for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Time Series via Spatial-Aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03248)
*Juntong Ni,Shiyu Wang,Ming Jin,Qi He,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces ST-Bench, a benchmark for spatio-temporal reasoning on time series, and STReasoner, an LLM-based method plus a spatially grounded RL algorithm (S-GRPO), achieving large accuracy gains at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatio-temporal reasoning over time series—combining temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context—is crucial for decision-making in domains like traffic, power grids, and epidemiology. Yet current methods mainly optimize predictive accuracy and neglect explicit reasoning, leaving no standard benchmark and limited methods for interpretable, spatially grounded reasoning.

Method: 1) Construct ST-Bench, a benchmark with four tasks (etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting), using a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline to generate rich spatio-temporal scenarios.
2) Propose STReasoner, a framework that enables LLMs to jointly leverage time series signals, graph (spatial) structure, and textual context for explicit reasoning.
3) Design S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that shapes LLM behavior by rewarding improvements specifically attributable to using spatial information, thereby encouraging spatially grounded logical reasoning.

Result: On ST-Bench and real-world datasets, STReasoner significantly outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy improvements between 17% and 135%, while using only 0.4% (0.004X) of the cost of proprietary (closed-source) models, and it shows strong generalization to real-world data.

Conclusion: Explicit spatio-temporal reasoning in time series can be substantially improved by combining a dedicated benchmark (ST-Bench), an LLM-based reasoning framework (STReasoner) that fuses time series, graphs, and text, and a spatially aware RL algorithm (S-GRPO). This setup not only advances reasoning performance and spatial grounding over existing methods but does so efficiently and with good generalization, providing a foundation for future research in high-stakes spatio-temporal decision-making systems.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal reasoning in time series involves the explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context. This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.

### [81] [Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) for Emergent Communication Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03254)
*Bastien Vanderplaetse,Xavier Siebert,Stéphane Dupont*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose an algorithm to automatically uncover semantic rules in the messages of agents that developed their own communication, making these emergent languages easier to interpret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-agent emergent communication, agents can invent their own languages, but these languages are typically hard for humans to interpret and analyze. There is a lack of tools to systematically and automatically reveal what these invented symbols and messages mean in relation to the input data.

Method: They train communicating agents on the Lewis Game using two different datasets, letting them develop emergent communication protocols. Then they introduce the Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which analyzes the exchanged messages, detects recurring patterns, and links these patterns to specific attributes of the input data.

Result: ASRD successfully finds relevant regularities in the agents’ messages and can associate these regularities with particular input attributes, effectively revealing parts of the semantics of the emergent language. This substantially reduces the manual effort required to interpret emergent communication.

Conclusion: Automated Semantic Rules Detection provides a practical way to interpret emergent languages in multi-agent systems by mapping message patterns to input attributes, thereby making analysis more tractable and supporting future research on interpretable emergent communication.

Abstract: The field of emergent communication within multi-agent systems examines how autonomous agents can independently develop communication strategies, without explicit programming, and adapt them to varied environments. However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.

### [82] [Textual Explanations and Their Evaluations for Reinforcement Learning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02514)
*Ahmad Terra,Mohit Ahmed,Rafia Inam,Elena Fersman,Martin Törngren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) framework that turns LLM-generated textual explanations of policies into transparent rules, refines them, and quantitatively evaluates their fidelity and performance across benchmark and industrial environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning policies are often black boxes, making it hard to verify that autonomous agents behave as humans expect. While textual explanations are intuitive for humans, current XRL methods struggle to guarantee their correctness and largely lack systematic, quantitative evaluation. There is a need for a framework that connects natural language explanations to verifiable, transparent representations of policy behavior, supports expert knowledge, and works in real-world settings.

Method: The authors design an XRL pipeline that: (1) uses an LLM plus clustering to generate textual explanations and extract frequent state–action conditions; (2) automatically derives predicates that capture semantic information of states; (3) converts frequent conditions into transparent symbolic rules; (4) evaluates rules on fidelity and task performance in the actual environment; and (5) applies two refinement procedures to improve explanation quality and reduce conflicts. Expert knowledge can be injected into the rule construction/refinement steps. The approach is tested on three open-source RL environments and one telecom industrial use case, and compared against the Autonomous Policy Explanation method.

Result: The framework successfully generates rule-based explanations from textual descriptions that achieve satisfactory performance and policy fidelity on several tasks. The refinement techniques reduce conflicting and low-quality explanations. Across the three open-source environments and the telecom use case, the method addresses weaknesses of Autonomous Policy Explanation and demonstrates that the induced transparent rules can approximate the original RL policy while remaining interpretable and evaluable.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical bridge between natural language explanations and formal, transparent representations of RL policies. It improves on prior XRL methods by enabling automatic predicate generation, rule extraction, refinement, and systematic quantitative evaluation of explanation fidelity and performance. The results indicate that high-quality, rule-based explanations can be derived from LLM-generated text and can perform well in both simulated and industrial domains, offering useful tools and insights for advancing explainable reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Understanding a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy is crucial for ensuring that autonomous agents behave according to human expectations. This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.

### [83] [SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02553)
*Jiaqi Liu,Yaofeng Su,Peng Xia,Siwei Han,Zeyu Zheng,Cihang Xie,Mingyu Ding,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimpleMem, a memory framework for LLM agents that uses semantic, lossless compression and adaptive retrieval to improve long-term interaction efficiency and accuracy, significantly boosting F1 while massively cutting token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents operating in long, complex interactions need memory systems that can manage large histories without redundant context or expensive iterative reasoning. Existing methods either keep all history (wasting tokens and introducing noise) or repeatedly reason to filter it (incurring high computational and token costs). The paper aims to develop a memory mechanism that preserves essential information while being far more efficient and scalable.

Method: The authors propose SimpleMem, a three-stage memory pipeline: (1) Semantic Structured Compression uses entropy-aware filtering to compress unstructured interaction logs into compact, structured, multi-view memory units while aiming to remain semantically lossless; (2) Recursive Memory Consolidation asynchronously merges related memory units into higher-level abstractions to eliminate redundancy and form hierarchical summaries; (3) Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval adjusts how much and what kind of memory to retrieve based on the complexity and needs of the current query, assembling a precise context with minimal tokens.

Result: On benchmark datasets, SimpleMem outperforms baseline memory approaches across accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost. It delivers an average F1 score improvement of 26.4% and reduces inference-time token consumption by up to 30x compared to prior methods, indicating that the framework effectively balances performance with computational and token efficiency.

Conclusion: SimpleMem offers a practical and scalable memory solution for LLM agents, demonstrating that semantically lossless compression combined with hierarchical consolidation and adaptive retrieval can substantially enhance both effectiveness and efficiency in long-term interactions. The method achieves better task performance while dramatically cutting token use, making it well-suited for real-world deployment of LLM agents in complex environments.

Abstract: To support reliable long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that efficiently manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

### [84] [Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577)
*Alexander Roman,Jacob Roman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orchestral is a lightweight, unified Python framework for building portable, type-safe LLM agents across multiple providers, simplifying tool calling, streaming, and orchestration while remaining suitable for both research and production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent frameworks either lock developers into specific vendors or require juggling multiple complex SDKs, leading to fragmented APIs, inconsistent tool-calling and streaming behavior, and obscured control flow that harms reproducibility and portability. There is a need for a simple, unified, and type-safe way to build cross-provider LLM agents without heavy infrastructure or architectural complexity.

Method: The authors design Orchestral, a Python framework that: (1) introduces a universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that works across major providers; (2) automatically generates tool schemas from Python type hints to ensure type safety without manual descriptors; (3) uses a synchronous execution model with streaming support for deterministic behavior and easy debugging; and (4) employs a modular architecture that separates provider adapters, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user interfaces, allowing extensibility and clean integration. They also implement advanced agent features like context compaction, sandboxed workspaces, user approval gates, sub-agents, memory, and MCP integration within this architecture.

Result: The resulting framework unifies tool calling and messaging across multiple LLM providers, removes the need for manual format conversion, and reduces framework-induced complexity. It demonstrates that advanced agent capabilities—such as rich tool use, memory, sandboxed execution, and multi-agent coordination—can be provided in a lightweight, synchronous, and provider-agnostic design that is suitable for both scientific workflows and production systems.

Conclusion: Orchestral shows that a small, modular, Python-first framework can provide a unified, type-safe abstraction over heterogeneous LLM provider APIs while still supporting sophisticated agent features. This approach mitigates vendor lock-in, improves reproducibility and debuggability, and offers a practical foundation for building portable LLM agents without the overhead and opacity of heavier agent ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

### [85] [An Empirical Study of On-Device Translation for Real-Time Live-Stream Chat on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02641)
*Jeiyoon Park,Daehwan Lee,Changmin Yeo,Yongshin Han,Minseop Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how to practically deploy on-device AI translation models on mobile devices, analyzing resource usage, model selection, and domain adaptation using a new Korean-English live chat benchmark, and shows they can match commercial systems on a targeted task under tight constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While on-device AI is efficient and privacy-friendly, there is little work on practical deployment issues like CPU usage, thermal limits, and resource constraints across diverse devices. The authors aim to understand what is needed to reliably run on-device models in real-world services, particularly for live chat translation, where latency, device variability, and continuous usage are critical.

Method: They build LiveChatBench, a benchmark of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentences specifically drawn from live-stream chat messages, capturing informal, domain-specific language. They then run extensive experiments on five different mobile devices to evaluate multiple on-device models. The study analyzes (i) how different model choices affect device resource consumption (CPU, thermal behavior, etc.) and (ii) the ability of these models to adapt to the live-chat domain, comparing them against a strong commercial baseline (GPT-5.1).

Result: Across the five tested mobile devices, the experiments show clear trade-offs between model size/architecture and resource consumption, and they identify model configurations that satisfy strict deployment constraints while still performing well on live-chat translation. The best on-device setups achieve translation quality on LiveChatBench that is comparable to the commercial GPT-5.1 model for this specific task.

Conclusion: On-device models, when carefully selected and configured with awareness of device-level constraints, can deliver translation quality similar to commercial cloud-based systems for well-targeted tasks like live-stream chat translation. The new LiveChatBench benchmark and the empirical findings about resource usage and domain adaptation can guide practitioners in designing and deploying real-world on-device AI applications.

Abstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.

### [86] [AWARE-US: Benchmark for Preference-Aware Resolution in Tool-Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02643)
*Mehmet Kurmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles how conversational agents should relax over-constrained database queries by inferring which constraints are least important to the user, using LLM-based preference modeling instead of ad hoc rules, and introduces a benchmark (AWARE-US) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational agents that call tools or databases often get user requests that are either underspecified or impossible to satisfy. Current systems either say “no results” or arbitrarily drop constraints, risking violation of user intent. There is a need for a principled, preference-aware way to decide which constraints to relax so that repaired queries still reflect what the user cares about most.

Method: The authors formulate infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem, where the agent must relax constraints based on their inferred importance to the user. They propose three LLM-based approaches to estimate relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, which infers importance in a context-sensitive, possibly turn-by-turn manner; (2) global one-shot weighting, which assigns importance scores in a single global inference step; and (3) pairwise ranking, where the model compares constraints in pairs to build a ranking of importance. They then apply these estimates to guide constraint relaxation when queries are unsatisfiable.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the local weighting method best matches user preference orderings (preference alignment), while the global one-shot weighting method is most accurate at choosing the correct subset of constraints to relax for infeasible queries. Pairwise ranking is evaluated but appears less effective than the leading methods on the main metrics. The paper also presents AWARE-US, a new benchmark consisting of persona-conditioned, ambiguity-rich query scenarios that test both disambiguation and preference-consistent infeasibility resolution.

Conclusion: LLM-based modeling of constraint importance from conversational context enables more user-aligned handling of infeasible database queries than ad hoc rule-based relaxation. Different estimation strategies trade off preference alignment and relaxation accuracy, with local weighting and global weighting excelling on different metrics. The new AWARE-US benchmark provides a standardized way to study and compare systems on persona-grounded, preference-aware query repair and disambiguation tasks.

Abstract: Tool-calling conversational agents querying structured databases often face two linked failures: underspecification (missing constraints needed to run a precise query) and infeasibility (the fully specified query returns an empty set because no item satisfies all constraints). Existing work often responds with "no results" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.

### [87] [Inferring Causal Graph Temporal Logic Formulas to Expedite Reinforcement Learning in Temporally Extended Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02666)
*Hadi Partovi Aria,Zhe Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A closed-loop RL framework (GTL-CIRL) that jointly learns policies and causal graph temporal logic specifications for better sample efficiency and interpretability on spatiotemporal graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard black-box RL on spatial-temporal graphs is sample-inefficient and hard to interpret because it does not explicitly reason about how local interventions propagate through network structure. There is a need for methods that incorporate causal and logical structure to get verifiable, interpretable policies and more efficient learning.

Method: Introduce GTL-CIRL, which integrates Causal Graph Temporal Logic with RL. The framework (1) shapes rewards using robustness metrics from Causal GTL formulas, (2) logs counterexamples when intended causal effects fail to materialize, and (3) uses Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization to tune parameters of causal templates. GP models exploit spatial and temporal correlations in dynamics to guide efficient exploration of the parameter space.

Result: In case studies on gene regulatory and power network environments, GTL-CIRL learns good policies faster than standard RL baselines. The discovered Causal GTL specifications provide interpretable, verifiable descriptions of the learned behavior, something missing in typical black-box RL approaches.

Conclusion: Coupling RL with causal graph temporal logic and GP-driven Bayesian optimization improves both learning speed and interpretability on spatiotemporal graph decision problems. GTL-CIRL offers a principled way to obtain verifiable policies and explicit causal specifications rather than opaque, purely reward-driven behavior.

Abstract: Decision-making tasks often unfold on graphs with spatial-temporal dynamics. Black-box reinforcement learning often overlooks how local changes spread through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. We present GTL-CIRL, a closed-loop framework that simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic (Causal GTL) specifications. The method shapes rewards with robustness, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and uses Gaussian Process (GP) driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in the system dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.

### [88] [Learning from Prompt itself: the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02683)
*Dongyu Chen,Jian Ma,Xianpeng Zhang,Lei Zhang,Haonan Lu,Chen Chen,Chuangchuang Wang,Kai Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAPO, a framework that optimizes prompts for large language models via hierarchical attribution and structured edits to improve performance without losing prior capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt engineering is an optimization problem, but existing automated prompt optimization methods often cause prompt drift, where fixing errors on some tasks harms performance on others, and many methods generate prompts from scratch, which hurts interpretability. There is a need for a structured, semi-automated optimization process that can efficiently refine prompts while preserving their strengths and remaining interpretable, especially in complex and multimodal tasks.

Method: The authors propose Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO), which operates on a structured hierarchy of a prompt. It introduces: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism that analyzes error patterns across training data and prompt history to identify which parts of the prompt contribute to failures; (2) semantic-unit optimization, where the system edits functional segments of the prompt instead of the whole text, preserving structure and interpretability; and (3) a multimodal-friendly progression that can work with both pure LLM settings and combined LLM–MLLM workflows. The framework iteratively refines prompts guided by attributions, focusing edits on problematic semantic units while tracking performance history to avoid prompt drift.

Result: When evaluated on tasks such as single and multi-image question answering (e.g., OCRV2) and complex reasoning/analysis benchmarks (e.g., BBH), HAPO achieves higher optimization efficiency and better task performance compared with other automated prompt optimization baselines. It reduces prompt drift and maintains or improves performance on previously solved tasks while fixing new errors, and it supports both unimodal and multimodal pipelines.

Conclusion: HAPO provides a structured, attribution-guided way to optimize prompts at the level of functional semantic units, enabling more reliable and interpretable prompt improvement than existing methods. Its demonstrated gains on QA and complex reasoning benchmarks, along with its compatibility with multimodal workflows, suggest it is a scalable and extensible paradigm for systematic prompt engineering across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.

### [89] [Learning User Preferences Through Interaction for Long-Term Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02702)
*Shuhaib Mehri,Priyanka Kargupta,Tal August,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a benchmark and methods for long-term conversational agents that remember and adapt to user preferences across multiple sessions, showing that persistent memory significantly improves collaboration quality and user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational agents typically optimize for single-turn or single-session performance and do not effectively accumulate and use knowledge about user preferences over time. As users repeatedly interact with agents, the ability to adapt to individual preferences is critical for long-term relationships, higher task success, and better collaboration. However, there is a lack of standardized benchmarks and methods to evaluate and train such long-term collaborative behavior.

Method: The authors introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark designed to test agents in multi-session collaborative scenarios where they must infer and use user preferences across repeated interactions. They design long-term collaborative agents endowed with a persistent memory module that stores, updates, and refines user preference information as interactions progress. They further exploit learning signals obtained from a user simulator within MultiSessionCollab to train agents to produce richer self-reflections and perform more effective memory updates, thereby improving preference modeling over time.

Result: Experimental evaluations on MultiSessionCollab show that agents augmented with persistent memory outperform baselines without memory, achieving higher task success, more efficient dialogues, and requiring less user effort across sessions. Additionally, training agents using learning signals from user simulator behavior leads to better quality reflections and memory updates. A human user study confirms that these memory-equipped agents improve perceived user experience in practical, real-world interaction settings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that persistent user-preference memory is a key component for effective long-term collaborative conversational agents. MultiSessionCollab provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating such capabilities, and leveraging simulator-derived learning signals to train reflection and memory-update mechanisms leads to measurable gains in both objective collaboration metrics and subjective user satisfaction. This establishes a foundation for future work on agents that build and maintain long-term relationships with users.

Abstract: As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.

### [90] [Time-Scaling Is What Agents Need Now](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02714)
*Zhi Liu,Guangzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that enhancing AI reasoning requires not just bigger models but architectures that explicitly extend and manage reasoning over time (“Time-Scaling”), enabling deeper, more flexible problem-space search similar to human sequential thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI paradigms—neural networks, reinforcement learning, and symbolic AI—have historically handled perception, action, and reasoning separately. Transformer-based LLMs and world models are merging these into more unified cognitive agents, but current LLMs, despite fluent text generation, still lack robust, efficient semantic reasoning. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, and explicit reasoning trajectories (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have improved reasoning by revealing intermediate steps, yet they suffer from incomplete and inefficient search. This motivates a more principled way to extend and control reasoning processes over time without simply scaling model size.

Method: Conceptual and architectural proposal: the authors introduce the notion of “Time-Scaling,” defined as designing agent architectures that deliberately allocate and structure extended temporal reasoning pathways. This includes mechanisms for longer and more flexible reasoning traces, dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth and strategies, and metacognitive control over when and how to expand or prune reasoning steps, analogous to human sequential reasoning under cognitive limits.

Result: The abstract does not present empirical or quantitative results; instead, it synthesizes trends from prior work (CoT, ToT, DeepSeek-R1, world models) and argues that their limitations collectively point toward the need for explicit Time-Scaling mechanisms. The main result is a theoretical framing that reinterprets advanced reasoning methods as partial, incomplete forms of temporal scaling and positions Time-Scaling as a unifying design principle for future cognitive agents.

Conclusion: To significantly advance deep reasoning and problem-solving in AI without linearly increasing model parameters, architectures must prioritize Time-Scaling: explicit, principled management of reasoning over time. By extending and optimizing temporal reasoning pathways—allowing richer problem-space exploration, adaptive strategies, and metacognition—agents can better approximate human-like sequential reasoning. The authors conclude that Time-Scaling should be treated as a foundational principle in the design of next-generation cognitive agents with closed-loop perception-decision-action capabilities.

Abstract: Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.
  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.
  This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.

### [91] [The Path Ahead for Agentic AI: Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02749)
*Nadia Sibai,Yara Ahmed,Serry Sibaee,Sawsan AlHalawani,Adel Ammar,Wadii Boulila*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The chapter surveys how large language models are evolving into autonomous, goal-driven agents and outlines the technical and governance challenges that must be solved for safe deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used not just for text generation but to drive autonomous behavior in complex environments. There is a need to understand how their capabilities translate into agent-like systems, what architectures support this transition, and what risks and open challenges arise as they move from language understanding to real-world action.

Method: The authors conduct a conceptual and architectural survey. They trace the evolution from statistical models to transformer-based LLMs, analyze the capabilities that enable agentic behavior, synthesize existing work into a reasoning–action–reflection loop, and propose an integrative framework decomposing agentic LLM systems into perception, memory, planning, and tool execution. They then critically review applications and challenges around safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability, and derive research priorities.

Result: The chapter identifies key architectural components and capabilities that support agentic behavior in LLM-based systems: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, adaptive decision-making, and structured loops of reasoning, acting, and reflecting. It organizes agentic systems around core modules (perception, memory, planning, tool use) and surfaces the main technical gaps and risk areas. It also highlights several priority research directions such as verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory designs, and governance mechanisms.

Conclusion: LLMs are on a trajectory from passive predictors to active agents, but current architectures and safeguards are not yet sufficient for trustworthy, autonomous deployment. Progress will require coordinated advances in technical robustness, interpretability, memory and planning architectures, multi-agent systems, and governance and safety frameworks. Only with such balanced development can agentic LLM systems be deployed responsibly while limiting misalignment and unintended consequences.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text generators to autonomous, goal-driven systems represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences.

### [92] [LLM Agent Framework for Intelligent Change Analysis in Urban Environment using Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02757)
*Zixuan Xiao,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChangeGPT is a general LLM+vision-agent framework for answering diverse real-world change detection queries, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating practical value for remote sensing decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing change detection methods are narrowly designed: they handle limited types of questions, struggle with varied real-world information needs (size, class, counts, etc.), and lack intelligent, multi-step reasoning over changes. There is a need for a more general, flexible, and intelligent system that can understand natural-language queries about changes, select appropriate vision tools, and produce reliable, comprehensive analyses for remote sensing applications.

Method: The authors design a general agent framework called ChangeGPT that integrates a Large Language Model backend with vision foundation models for change detection. They use a hierarchical control structure to reduce hallucinations and enable better reasoning and tool orchestration. They curate a benchmark of 140 questions, grouped by realistic scenarios and question types (Size, Class, Number, and varying difficulty). The agent’s performance is evaluated by its accuracy in tool selection (Precision/Recall) and its overall correctness in answering queries (Match). They also apply ChangeGPT in a real-world urban change monitoring case study in Qianhai Bay, Shenzhen.

Result: ChangeGPT, particularly when powered by GPT-4-turbo, achieves a high query accuracy with a 90.71% Match rate on the curated dataset. It shows strong performance on complex, multi-step change-related questions and demonstrates robust tool selection behavior, as indicated by favorable Precision/Recall metrics. In the real-world case study of urban change monitoring, it effectively analyzes multi-type changes, illustrating its practical usefulness.

Conclusion: ChangeGPT provides an intelligent, adaptable agent framework for remote sensing change detection, capable of handling diverse natural-language queries and performing multi-type, multi-step change analysis. Its high accuracy, strong tool selection, and success in a real-world urban monitoring scenario suggest it is a powerful aid for decision-making in remote sensing and related applications.

Abstract: Existing change detection methods often lack the versatility to handle diverse real-world queries and the intelligence for comprehensive analysis. This paper presents a general agent framework, integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with vision foundation models to form ChangeGPT. A hierarchical structure is employed to mitigate hallucination. The agent was evaluated on a curated dataset of 140 questions categorized by real-world scenarios, encompassing various question types (e.g., Size, Class, Number) and complexities. The evaluation assessed the agent's tool selection ability (Precision/Recall) and overall query accuracy (Match). ChangeGPT, especially with a GPT-4-turbo backend, demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 90.71 % Match rate. Its strength lies particularly in handling change-related queries requiring multi-step reasoning and robust tool selection. Practical effectiveness was further validated through a real-world urban change monitoring case study in Qianhai Bay, Shenzhen. By providing intelligence, adaptability, and multi-type change analysis, ChangeGPT offers a powerful solution for decision-making in remote sensing applications.

### [93] [HAL: Inducing Human-likeness in LLMs with Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02813)
*Masum Hasan,Junjie Zhao,Ehsan Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents HAL, a framework that makes ‘human-likeness’ in dialogue measurable and uses it as a reward to align LLMs toward more human-like conversation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-likeness is central to good human-AI interaction, but it is hard to define and quantify. Current improvements in human-like behavior mostly come from scaling models or broad supervised training, not from explicitly aligning models to human conversational traits. The authors aim to create a principled, interpretable way to define, measure, and optimize conversational human-likeness.

Method: They build HAL (Human Aligning LLMs), which: (1) collects contrastive dialogue data that distinguishes human from non-human-like behavior; (2) extracts explicit conversational traits from this data; (3) combines these traits into a single scalar ‘human-likeness’ score; and (4) uses this score as a transparent reward in standard preference-optimization-based alignment for LLMs of different sizes.

Result: Using HAL to align various language models increases how often human evaluators judge the models’ conversations as human-like, without degrading the models’ overall capabilities on other tasks. The trait-based reward is interpretable, so one can inspect which traits drive behavior and detect side effects of alignment.

Conclusion: HAL shows that soft, qualitative aspects of language—like conversational human-likeness—can be operationalized into explicit, interpretable traits, turned into a scalar reward, and used for alignment. This offers a transparent, explainable path to aligning LLMs with nuanced conversational properties beyond traditional task performance metrics.

Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.

### [94] [Causal-Enhanced AI Agents for Medical Research Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02814)
*Duc Ngo,Arya Rahgoza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system, CausalAgent, that eliminates hallucinations in AI-assisted systematic reviews for medical evidence synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual systematic reviews are infeasible at current publication scales, and existing AI tools hallucinate too often for safe use in high-stakes clinical contexts. The authors aim to create an AI system that can reliably support evidence-based medicine by grounding every causal claim in retrieved literature and making causal reasoning explicit.

Method: They design a retrieval-augmented generation architecture enhanced with explicit causal reasoning and dual-level knowledge graphs. The system enforces an “evidence-first” workflow: all causal claims must be traceable to retrieved documents, and it automatically constructs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that represent intervention-to-outcome causal pathways for visual and structural analysis.

Result: On a dataset of 234 abstracts about dementia and exercise, CausalAgent achieved 95% answer accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations, compared with a baseline AI system’s 34% accuracy and 10% hallucination rate. The system successfully generated causal graphs that captured mechanisms and relationships in the literature.

Conclusion: The proof-of-concept shows that combining causal graphs with RAG can drastically reduce hallucinations and improve reliability, interpretability, and mechanism modeling in AI-assisted systematic reviews. Although tested on a narrow domain (dementia exercise and ten questions), the architecture demonstrates principles that are transferable to broader trustworthy medical AI applications and high-stakes causal reasoning tasks in healthcare.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are essential for evidence-based medicine, but reviewing 1.5 million+ annual publications manually is infeasible. Current AI approaches suffer from hallucinations in systematic review tasks, with studies reporting rates ranging from 28--40% for earlier models to 2--15% for modern implementations which is unacceptable when errors impact patient care.
  We present a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system integrating explicit causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs. Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways.
  Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI. Automatic causal graphs enable explicit mechanism modeling, visual synthesis, and enhanced interpretability. While this proof-of-concept evaluation used ten questions focused on dementia exercise research, the architectural approach demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI and causal reasoning's potential for high-stakes healthcare.

### [95] [Quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention for spatial permeability prediction in oilfield reservoirs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02818)
*Muzhen Zhang,Yujie Cheng,Zhanxiang Lei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum-enhanced LSTM with attention (QLSTMA) integrating variational quantum circuits to improve spatial prediction of reservoir permeability, achieving notably lower prediction errors than classical LSTMA and laying groundwork for future deployment on real quantum hardware in geoscience applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Permeability is a key reservoir parameter for oil and gas exploration and development, but its large dynamic range and strong spatial variability make accurate spatial prediction difficult for existing classical machine learning approaches. The authors are motivated to find a modeling framework that can better capture complex nonlinear relationships in well-logging data and improve prediction reliability, especially in geologically complex regions.

Method: The authors design a quantum-classical hybrid neural network by embedding variational quantum circuits into the recurrent cell of an LSTM with attention, forming the QLSTMA model. They construct two variants—QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and QLSTMA with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG)—to explore different ways of mapping LSTM gates to quantum circuits and to study the impact of quantum architecture and qubit number. The models are trained and evaluated on permeability prediction tasks using simulated quantum circuits (classical backends), and performance is compared against a conventional LSTMA baseline using MAE and RMSE metrics.

Result: The experiments show that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG architecture delivers the best performance, reducing MAE by 19% and RMSE by 20% relative to the classical LSTMA with attention. The accuracy improvements are particularly pronounced in regions where the well-logging signals are highly complex. The study further observes that increasing the number of qubits generally improves prediction accuracy, even though the quantum parts are simulated on classical hardware.

Conclusion: The study concludes that incorporating variational quantum circuits into recurrent neural networks for subsurface spatial prediction is both feasible and beneficial, significantly enhancing permeability prediction compared to classical LSTM-based models. The demonstrated gains suggest that quantum entanglement and superposition can better represent complex geological relationships. The proposed QLSTMA framework provides a foundation for future implementation on real quantum processors and indicates strong potential for broader applications of quantum-classical hybrid models in petroleum engineering and geoscience.

Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.

### [96] [Sample-Efficient Neurosymbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02850)
*Celeste Veronese,Daniele Meli,Alessandro Farinelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic deep reinforcement learning method that uses logical rules derived from simple tasks as priors to make learning in complex environments more sample-efficient, generalizable, and interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL methods are powerful but data-hungry and often fail to generalize from small training scenarios to more complex, unseen tasks. They also require extensive hyperparameter tuning from scratch for each new problem and lack interpretability and trustworthiness, especially in sparse-reward, long-horizon environments. The authors are motivated to leverage existing symbolic knowledge to guide and speed up DRL, improving sample efficiency, generalization, and transparency of the decision process.

Method: The authors propose a neuro-symbolic DRL framework where partial policies obtained from simple domain instances are encoded as logical rules. During training on more complex tasks, these rules are used for online symbolic reasoning that interacts with the RL agent in two ways: (i) during exploration, the rules bias the action distribution toward actions preferred by the symbolic policy; and (ii) during exploitation, the rules rescale the Q-values to align with symbolic guidance. This transfers useful priors from easy tasks to harder ones without retraining from scratch, and keeps the symbolic layer interpretable.

Result: On challenging gridworld variants, including fully and partially observable settings, the proposed method converges faster and achieves better performance compared to a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline. It is particularly effective in sparse-reward tasks and those requiring long planning horizons, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating symbolic background knowledge in the form of logical-rule partial policies into DRL can significantly improve sample efficiency, convergence speed, and generalization while enhancing interpretability and trust. The neuro-symbolic approach provides a principled way to transfer knowledge from simple to complex tasks and outperforms existing structured-RL baselines in gridworld experiments, suggesting its promise for broader sequential decision-making problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.

### [97] [M3MAD-Bench: Are Multi-Agent Debates Really Effective Across Domains and Modalities?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02854)
*Ao Li,Jinghui Zhang,Luyu Li,Yuxiang Duan,Lang Gao,Mingcai Chen,Weijun Qin,Shaopeng Li,Fengxian Ji,Ning Liu,Lizhen Cui,Xiuying Chen,Yuntao Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3MAD-Bench, a unified, extensible benchmark to systematically evaluate Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) methods across multiple domains, modalities, and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-Agent Debate research is hard to compare fairly because evaluations are done under fragmented, inconsistent setups and are mostly limited to text-only tasks. There is no unified, standardized benchmark that spans different task domains, supports multimodal (vision-language) inputs, and measures both effectiveness and efficiency. This gap prevents systematic understanding and progress in MAD methods.

Method: The authors design M3MAD-Bench, a benchmark that defines standardized evaluation protocols over five task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning. It includes both pure text and vision-language datasets to allow controlled comparison across modalities. They instantiate multiple MAD methods on nine different base models covering diverse architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. The benchmark also logs not just accuracy but efficiency-related metrics such as token usage and inference time, enabling performance–cost analysis. Extensive experiments are run under this unified framework to analyze MAD behavior.

Result: Using M3MAD-Bench, the authors obtain systematic empirical results on how different MAD methods perform across domains, modalities, and model types, revealing patterns in effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. They provide quantitative comparisons that highlight trade-offs between answer quality and resource consumption, and show how MAD performance varies between text-only and multimodal settings.

Conclusion: M3MAD-Bench serves as a reliable, standardized foundation for evaluating Multi-Agent Debate methods across diverse domains and modalities. By offering unified protocols, multimodal coverage, and multi-dimensional metrics (accuracy and efficiency), it enables fair comparison, deeper analysis of MAD behavior, and supports future research and development in this area. The benchmark and its codebase are made publicly available to encourage further work.

Abstract: As an agent-level reasoning and coordination paradigm, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestrates multiple agents through structured debate to improve answer quality and support complex reasoning. However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench.

### [98] [SimRPD: Optimizing Recruitment Proactive Dialogue Agents through Simulator-Based Data Evaluation and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02871)
*Zhiyong Cao,Dunqiang Liu,Qi Dai,Haojun Xu,Huaiyan Xu,Huan He,Yafei Liu,Siyuan Liu,XiaoLin Lin,Ke Ma,Ruqian Shi,Sijia Yao,Hao Wang,Sicheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes SimRPD, a three-stage framework using a high-fidelity user simulator plus a Chain-of-Intention-based evaluation to generate and filter synthetic dialogues for training proactive recruitment dialogue agents, achieving better performance and industrial applicability than prior simulator-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training task-oriented proactive dialogue agents for recruitment is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-quality, goal-oriented domain data, especially for business outcomes like collecting social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Existing supervised and RL approaches work but are data-hungry and domain-specific, and current simulator-based data generation and selection are not sufficiently reliable or fine-grained for industrial deployment.

Method: SimRPD is a three-stage framework: (1) construct a high-fidelity user simulator that can engage in multi-turn online recruitment dialogues to generate large-scale synthetic interaction data; (2) evaluate and filter this data using a multi-dimensional framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI), which applies both global-level (overall dialogue quality and goal progress) and instance-level (turn- or case-specific) metrics to assess both the simulator and the dialogues; (3) use the curated, high-quality subset of simulated dialogues to train a task-oriented proactive recruitment dialogue agent via standard learning methods such as supervised fine-tuning and/or reinforcement learning.

Result: In real-world recruitment experiments, agents trained with SimRPD-selected data outperform agents trained with data chosen by existing simulator-based selection strategies, demonstrating better effectiveness in achieving recruitment goals (e.g., obtaining social-media contacts) and improved dialogue performance metrics.

Conclusion: SimRPD provides an effective way to overcome data scarcity for proactive, goal-driven recruitment dialogue agents by combining a high-fidelity simulator with CoI-based multi-dimensional evaluation and data selection. Its success in an industrial recruitment setting suggests strong practical value and indicates that the framework can be generalized to other business-oriented, task-driven dialogue scenarios where high-quality domain data is limited.

Abstract: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents play a pivotal role in recruitment, particularly for steering conversations towards specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

### [99] [ReTreVal: Reasoning Tree with Validation - A Hybrid Framework for Enhanced LLM Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02880)
*Abhishek HS,Pavan C Shekar,Arpit Jain,Ashwanth Krishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTreVal is a hybrid multi-step reasoning framework that combines tree-structured exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based validation, and cross-problem memory to improve LLM performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-step reasoning methods like ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine help LLMs reason better through reflection and iterative refinement, but they do not systematically explore multiple solution paths nor accumulate reusable knowledge across problems. There is a need for a framework that can both explore reasoning space in a structured way and learn persistently from past successes and failures, especially for domains like math and creative writing where reasoning depth and reliability are crucial.

Method: ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation) builds a Tree-of-Thoughts style reasoning tree whose depth adapts to problem complexity. Each node in the tree represents a partial reasoning state and is iteratively refined using self-critique based on explicit feedback generated by the LLM itself. A dual validation mechanism, also LLM-based, scores each node on reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness. A critique-based pruning strategy keeps only the top-k nodes at each level to control compute while preserving promising paths. In parallel, a reflexion memory buffer stores insights from successful reasoning trajectories and common failure patterns, which can be reused for future problems to guide exploration and refinement.

Result: On a benchmark of 500 mathematical and creative writing problems using Qwen 2.5 7B, ReTreVal is reported to consistently outperform baselines ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine. The improvements are attributed to more systematic exploration, better validation of intermediate steps, and reuse of experience via the reflexion memory.

Conclusion: ReTreVal provides a bounded, validated, and learning-capable approach to multi-step reasoning in LLMs. By integrating structured Tree-of-Thoughts exploration with critique-driven refinement and cross-problem memory, it is particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, strong verification of intermediate steps, and transfer of insights across different problems.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning remains a key challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in complex domains such as mathematics and creative writing. While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.

### [100] [Logical Phase Transitions: Understanding Collapse in LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02902)
*Xinglang Zhang,Yunyao Zhang,ZeLiang Chen,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang,Zikai Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discovers a sharp “phase transition” in LLM logical reasoning as task depth increases, and introduces a neuro-symbolic curriculum method that stabilizes and improves reasoning at higher logical complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are powerful at natural language, their ability to perform symbolic logical reasoning—crucial for math, law, and other high‑stakes domains—remains weak and poorly understood. Prior work has not systematically examined how performance changes as logical complexity (depth of reasoning steps) grows, nor provided targeted training strategies to handle these failures. The authors aim to characterize this behavior and design methods to push LLMs’ reliable reasoning to greater depths.

Method: 1) Systematically construct or use benchmarks where logical complexity (logical depth / number of compositional steps) can be precisely controlled. 2) Measure LLM performance as this depth increases to identify patterns in accuracy. 3) Observe and formalize the phenomenon of “Logical Phase Transitions,” where performance remains high within a certain depth regime and then abruptly collapses beyond a critical depth. 4) Propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning: a training framework that (a) aligns natural language with explicit logical symbols to build a shared representation, and (b) structures training curricula and optimization around the discovered phase-transition boundaries, gradually increasing depth to strengthen reasoning at higher complexity. 5) Evaluate on five benchmarks under naive prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

Result: Experiments show that standard LLM reasoning exhibits clear phase-transition-like behavior, with abrupt drops in accuracy past certain logical depths. Applying Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning significantly reduces this collapse, delivering average accuracy improvements of about +1.26 points under naive prompting and +3.95 points under CoT prompting on five logical reasoning benchmarks, and also enhances generalization to unseen logical compositions.

Conclusion: LLM logical reasoning does not degrade smoothly with complexity but undergoes sharp phase transitions at specific logical depths. Recognizing and exploiting these transition points allows the design of a neuro-symbolic curriculum that better aligns language with logic and focuses training where failure emerges. This approach meaningfully extends the reliable reasoning depth of LLMs and improves robustness and generalization on complex logical tasks.

Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions. Code and data are available at https://github.com/AI4SS/Logical-Phase-Transitions.

### [101] [Batch-of-Thought: Cross-Instance Learning for Enhanced LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02950)
*Xuan Yang,Furong Jia,Roy Xie,Xiong Xi,Hengwei Bian,Jian Li,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a method that lets LLMs reason over groups of related queries jointly instead of independently, improving accuracy, calibration, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reasoning pipelines treat each query in isolation, ignoring useful shared structure across similar problems and opportunities for joint consistency checks. This wastes information and compute, and leads to uncalibrated and sometimes error-prone reasoning. The authors want a way to exploit cross-instance signals without retraining models.

Method: They introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free approach that processes a batch of related queries together. The system performs comparative analysis across instances to find recurring high-quality reasoning templates, apply cross-instance consistency constraints, and share reasoning effort. They implement BoT in a multi-agent reflection framework called BoT-R, where a dedicated Reflector agent jointly evaluates and compares candidate solutions from the batch to extract mutual information that isolated runs would miss.

Result: Across three different LLM families and six reasoning benchmarks, the BoT-R architecture achieves higher accuracy and better confidence calibration, while cutting inference costs by as much as 61% compared to standard per-query processing. Theoretical and empirical analyses characterize the conditions under which batch-aware reasoning yields these gains.

Conclusion: Jointly reasoning over batches of related queries, rather than treating each query independently, can systematically improve LLM reasoning systems. The Batch-of-Thought and BoT-R framework shows that training-free, batch-aware, multi-agent reflection can leverage cross-instance structure and consistency to achieve better performance and efficiency, and the paper clarifies when such approaches are most beneficial.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals such as shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints. We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. By performing comparative analysis across batches, BoT identifies high-quality reasoning templates, detects errors through consistency checks, and amortizes computational costs. We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%. Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveals when and why batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems.

### [102] [Rationale-Grounded In-Context Learning for Time Series Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02968)
*Qingxiang Liu,Zhiqing Cui,Xiaoliang Luo,Yuqian Wu,Zhuoyang Jiang,Huaiyu Wan,Sheng Sun,Lvchun Wang,Wei Yu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes RationaleTS, a rationale-grounded in-context learning framework that improves time series reasoning in multimodal large language models by using retrieved, label-conditioned rationales as guiding reasoning paths rather than post-hoc explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models perform poorly on time series reasoning tasks because they lack explicit rationale priors that link temporal observations to downstream outcomes. Without such priors, models tend to rely on shallow pattern matching over temporal data instead of structured, causal-style reasoning, limiting their reliability and generalization, especially in complex or cross-domain time series applications.

Method: The authors introduce RationaleTS, a rationale-grounded in-context learning method for time series reasoning. First, they induce label-conditioned rationales, which are structured reasoning paths from observable temporal evidence to potential outcomes. Next, they design a hybrid retrieval mechanism that jointly considers temporal patterns and semantic context to find relevant rationale priors from a repository. These retrieved rationales are then used as in-context guidance for the model when performing inference on new time series samples, so that reasoning is explicitly steered by the priors rather than being purely pattern-based.

Result: Through extensive experiments across three different time series domains, the authors show that RationaleTS achieves improved effectiveness and efficiency in time series reasoning compared with existing multimodal large language models and baseline approaches that lack rationale-grounded priors. The empirical results indicate better reasoning quality and performance on the evaluated tasks.

Conclusion: Embedding label-conditioned, retrieved rationales as guiding reasoning units within an in-context learning framework can substantially enhance time series reasoning in multimodal large language models. RationaleTS demonstrates that connecting temporal observations to outcomes via explicit reasoning paths, combined with hybrid temporal-semantic retrieval, provides a more principled and effective alternative to superficial pattern matching. The approach is generalizable across domains, and the authors plan to release code to facilitate reproduction and further research.

Abstract: The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction.

### [103] [Explainable Fuzzy GNNs for Leak Detection in Water Distribution Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03062)
*Qusai Khaled,Pasquale De Marinis,Moez Louati,David Ferras,Laura Genga,Uzay Kaymak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An explainable fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) is proposed for leak detection and localization in water distribution networks, slightly sacrificing accuracy compared to a standard GENConv GNN but providing interpretable, rule-based explanations for predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leak detection in water distribution networks is essential, but existing GNN approaches, while accurate, operate as black boxes, limiting trust and adoption in real-world engineering practice. There is a lack of graph-based explainable models tailored to water networks that can highlight critical regions and give understandable reasoning behind leak predictions.

Method: The authors benchmark multiple GNN architectures on leak detection/localization tasks using sensor data over water distribution network graphs. They choose generalized graph convolution networks (GENConv) as the base due to superior performance. They then design a fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) that integrates mutual information to select critical network regions and applies fuzzy logic to transform learned representations into transparent, rule-based explanations for node classification (leak detection and localization).

Result: The proposed FGENConv model attains Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for leak detection and 0.814 for leak localization, which are slightly lower than the standard (crisp) GENConv scores of 0.938 and 0.858. However, FGENConv additionally produces spatially localized fuzzy rules that explain why certain nodes or regions are classified as leaking.

Conclusion: Although FGENConv yields marginally lower F1 performance than the non-explainable GENConv, it offers interpretable, spatially localized fuzzy rule-based explanations that can be inspected and validated by hydraulic engineers. This trade-off between accuracy and explainability can support more trustworthy leak detection, better allocation of human resources, and improved maintenance strategies in water distribution networks.

Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies. The code is available at github.com/pasqualedem/GNNLeakDetection.

### [104] [A framework for assuring the accuracy and fidelity of an AI-enabled Digital Twin of en route UK airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03120)
*Adam Keane,Nick Pepper,Chris Burr,Amy Hodgkin,Dewi Gould,John Korna,Marc Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes and applies an assurance framework to show that a probabilistic Digital Twin of UK en‑route airspace is accurate, fit for AI ATC research, and aligned with emerging ATM/AI regulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital Twins and AI controllers for air traffic management are promising but face a developing, application-specific regulatory landscape. Stakeholders and regulators need clear, structured evidence that such Digital Twins faithfully represent real airspace and are safe and appropriate for training and testing AI ATC agents. There is a gap in practical assurance methods tailored to ATM Digital Twins.

Method: The authors build an assurance framework for a probabilistic Digital Twin of UK en‑route airspace (Project Bluebird). They draw on emerging guidance for Digital Twin development and AI/ML in ATM, and use the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) methodology to construct a structured assurance case. This consists of nested, structured arguments linking high‑level assurance goals to specific evidence, with explicit assumptions and justifications. The paper gives an overview of all argument strands and provides detailed “deep dives” on selected arguments and their evidence requirements.

Result: The outcome is a concrete assurance framework and instantiated assurance case for the Bluebird Digital Twin. It specifies actionable assurance goals, identifies the evidence needed to show that the Digital Twin is an accurate and sufficiently functional representation of UK en‑route airspace for the intended AI ATC use cases, and documents the Twin’s strengths, limitations, and areas needing fidelity improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed TEA-based assurance framework offers a structured way to justify and document the trustworthiness and fitness-for-purpose of ATM Digital Twins. It supports researchers in systematically assessing fidelity and limitations, and provides a practical foundation for discussions with stakeholders and regulators. By serving as a worked example, it also informs and contributes to emerging regulatory guidance for Digital Twins and AI/ML in Air Traffic Management.

Abstract: Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.
  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.
  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.

### [105] [Automatic Prompt Engineering with No Task Cues and No Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03130)
*Faisal Chowdhury,Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Niharika S D'Souza,Horst Samulowitz,Neeru Gupta,Tomasz Hanusiak,Michal Kapitonow*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple, tuning‑free automatic prompt engineering system and demonstrates that it works as well as more complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic prompt engineering methods are often complex, may require tuning or task‑specific hints, and have not been explored for cryptic column name expansion (CNE) or for non‑English languages. Since understanding cryptic column names is crucial for finding, accessing, and interpreting tabular data, there is a need for a simpler, broadly applicable approach.

Method: Design an automatic prompt engineering system that does not rely on parameter tuning or explicit task descriptions. Apply this system to the CNE task, where cryptic column names in database tables must be expanded into meaningful, descriptive names, and evaluate it on datasets in English and German to compare its effectiveness with prior approaches.

Result: The proposed system achieves effectiveness comparable to existing, more complex automatic prompt engineering approaches on the CNE task across both English and German datasets.

Conclusion: A simple, tuning‑free automatic prompt engineering system can perform on par with more complex methods and is viable for cryptic column name expansion. This represents the first application of automatic prompt engineering to CNE and to a language other than English, suggesting broader applicability of such methods beyond previously studied settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for automatic prompt engineering that is much simpler in both design and application and yet as effective as the existing approaches. It requires no tuning and no explicit clues about the task. We evaluated our approach on cryptic column name expansion (CNE) in database tables, a task which is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding and yet there has been very little existing work. We evaluated on datasets in two languages, English and German. This is the first work to report on the application of automatic prompt engineering for the CNE task. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work on the application of automatic prompt engineering for a language other than English.

TL;DR: InfiAgent is a framework for long-horizon LLM agents that keeps the model’s context small by storing all persistent information in external files and reconstructing context from that state plus a short recent history, enabling stable performance over very long tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle on long, complex tasks because their prompts grow without bound, causing context overflow and accumulated reasoning errors. Existing fixes like context compression or retrieval help but force trade-offs between preserving detailed information and maintaining reasoning stability. A more principled way is needed to let agents work over long horizons without relying on ever-growing context windows.

Method: InfiAgent introduces a file-centric state abstraction: instead of retaining all past dialogue and tool calls in the prompt, the agent writes persistent information (notes, intermediate results, plans, artifacts) into a structured workspace of files. At each step, the agent receives only (1) a snapshot summary of this workspace state and (2) a fixed-size window of the most recent actions, keeping the token context strictly bounded. The framework is general-purpose and works with standard LLMs and tools, without task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: On benchmarks like DeepResearch and a demanding 80-paper literature review task, InfiAgent powered by a 20B open-source model achieves performance comparable to much larger proprietary systems. Compared to baseline agents that rely on large or growing contexts, InfiAgent maintains significantly better coverage and robustness on long-horizon tasks, showing less degradation as task length increases.

Conclusion: Explicitly externalizing agent state into a structured file-based workspace, and reconstructing prompts from that state plus a short recent history, is an effective strategy for building stable long-horizon LLM agents. This design keeps context bounded, reduces error accumulation, and delivers competitive performance without specialized training, suggesting a practical foundation for scalable autonomous agents.

Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent

### [107] [MAGMA: A Multi-Graph based Agentic Memory Architecture for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03236)
*Dongming Jiang,Yi Li,Guanpeng Li,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGMA is a new memory architecture for LLMs that uses multiple graphs (semantic, temporal, causal, entity) and policy-guided traversal to improve long-context reasoning and interpretability, outperforming prior memory-augmented systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Memory-Augmented Generation methods usually store all memories in a single, flat space and rely on semantic similarity search. This mixes temporal, causal, and entity information, reducing interpretability and causing misalignment between what a query needs and what the retriever returns. This leads to weaker long-horizon reasoning performance. The paper aims to disentangle these factors and make retrieval more structured, controllable, and transparent.

Method: The paper introduces MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture. Each memory item is represented simultaneously in four orthogonal graphs: semantic, temporal, causal, and entity. Retrieval is framed as a policy-guided traversal over these graphs, so the system can choose which relations and paths to follow depending on the query. Memory representation (graphs) is decoupled from retrieval logic (policies), allowing more flexible and interpretable retrieval and structured construction of the LLM’s context window.

Result: On long-context reasoning benchmarks such as LoCoMo and LongMemEval, MAGMA outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory and memory-augmented LLM systems. The improvements are consistent across tasks that stress long-horizon and structured reasoning, indicating that the multi-graph and policy-guided traversal design yields better evidence selection and reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: Decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic via a multi-graph architecture leads to more interpretable, controllable, and effective memory-augmented generation. MAGMA’s orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs plus policy-guided traversal offer a principled way to align retrieval with query intent, improving long-horizon reasoning performance over prior approaches.

Abstract: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.
