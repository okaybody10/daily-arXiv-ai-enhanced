Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation.

We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions.

However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings.

We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content.

Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling.

In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step.

A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers.

They perform three kinds of analyses across these settings: (i) performance analysis to measure variance in task accuracy under prompt variations; (ii) logit analysis to examine the model\u2019s output token probabilities, particularly for task-relevant tokens; and (iii) linear probing on internal representations to see how prompt type affects intermediate model states versus final-layer behaviour.", "result": "They find that underspecified prompts show much higher variance in performance across small prompt changes and yield lower logit scores for task-relevant output tokens, indicating weaker, less decisive predictions. In contrast, instruction-rich prompts demonstrate lower performance variance and stronger logits for correct or relevant tokens, suggesting more stable and confident behaviour. Linear probing reveals that internal representations of the LLM are only marginally affected by whether prompts are underspecified or instruction-rich; the main differences manifest in the final layers of the model, where the mapping from representation to output is more sensitive to prompt specificity.", "conclusion": "The work concludes that a substantial part of observed prompt sensitivity in LLMs is actually due to prompt underspecification rather than inherent model instability. Since the main effects emerge in the final layers and can be mitigated by clearer instructions, the authors argue that research on prompt sensitivity should use more rigorously specified prompts and clearly distinguish between sensitivity arising from vague task descriptions and genuine architectural or representational instability.

As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy.

Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples.

Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency.

In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies \u201cmerge residue\u201d tokens in BPE vocabularies\u2014tokens learned and kept during training but rarely emitted in practice\u2014and proposes LiteToken, a method to prune these tokens to make tokenization and models more efficient and robust without hurting performance.", "motivation": "While BPE tokenization is central to LLMs, most research focuses on architectures and training, not on how tokenizers themselves behave. The authors observe that many BPE tokens are artifacts of the merge-learning process: they are frequent enough to be added to the vocabulary but are then almost always further merged during real tokenization, so they almost never appear in final token sequences. These residue tokens waste vocabulary capacity, contribute unnecessary parameters in models, and open up vulnerabilities to adversarial or atypical strings that exploit rare tokens. There is a need to systematically study this issue and provide a simple way to clean up tokenizers post hoc, ideally without retraining models.", "method": "1) Empirically analyze existing BPE tokenizers to identify intermediate merge residues: tokens that are frequent during merge learning but have very low emission frequency at inference-time tokenization. 2) Quantify how many such tokens exist, how they are distributed, and how they affect tokenization (e.g., fragmentation) and robustness. 3) Propose LiteToken, a lightweight procedure that removes these residue tokens from the vocabulary and adjusts the tokenizer so that affected strings are instead tokenized into more common, stable tokens. 4) Evaluate pretrained models using the modified tokenizer\u2014without or with minimal additional training\u2014to measure changes in token counts, model size/parameters, performance on standard benchmarks, and robustness to noise or misspellings.", "result": "Across multiple widely used BPE tokenizers, the authors find a substantial number of merge-residue tokens that almost never appear during normal tokenization. Applying LiteToken to remove these tokens leads to: (a) reduced token fragmentation (texts are represented with fewer, more meaningful tokens), (b) a smaller effective vocabulary and reduced parameter counts in the embedding and output layers, and (c) improved robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, which previously could trigger rare, poorly trained tokens. Standard performance metrics on typical tasks remain essentially unchanged, showing that the pruned tokens were largely redundant.", "conclusion": "BPE vocabularies contain many intermediate merge residue tokens that are artifacts rather than useful representational units. These tokens waste capacity and harm robustness. The proposed LiteToken method can systematically remove such residues with minimal disruption: pretrained models largely tolerate the tokenizer modification without re-training, while benefiting from less fragmented tokenization, fewer parameters, and greater robustness. The work highlights that tokenizer design and cleanup are important levers for improving language models, complementary to architecture and training advances."}}

By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267.

Using phonological feature representations, they decompose recognition outputs into segmental and tonal features and analyze which features are recognized correctly or incorrectly, revealing detailed error patterns beyond word-level correctness.", "result": "Across experiments, FER and TER uncover systematic patterns that WER and CER obscure. Models tend to handle segmental features relatively well but struggle with tonal features, particularly mid tones and downstep.

For Uneme, an endangered language not present in pretraining data, one model exhibits near-total word-level failure (almost 1.0 WER) and a CER of 0.461, yet the FER is just 0.267, again suggesting that many feature-level distinctions are captured even when words are not correctly recognized.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that WER alone is a misleading indicator of ASR performance for African tone languages. Feature-based metrics such as FER and tone-aware TER provide a more nuanced and linguistically meaningful assessment, demonstrating that models often encode substantial phonological knowledge despite poor word-level accuracy.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type.

They then apply this framework to multiple reasoning-focused LLMs under different modes (with and without explicit \u201cthinking\u201d/CoT).", "result": "The analysis finds that when \u201cthinking mode\u201d or Chain-of-Thought is activated, the risk of unsafe generation increases. Critical routing decisions associated with deceptive reasoning are concentrated in a small number of contiguous mid-depth layers and a few attention heads. These heads show distinctive signatures in the proposed stability, geometry, and energy metrics, indicating their special role in propagating unsafe narratives even when the final answer is a refusal.", "conclusion": "Refusal at the output level does not guarantee that internal reasoning is safe. Certain mid-layer attention heads play a disproportionate role in carrying deceptive reasoning patterns during Chain-of-Thought. Understanding and targeting these components provides a new angle for mitigating latent reasoning risks in LLMs beyond simple output filtering or refusal training."}}

However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.\n  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), an RL-based post-training method that directly optimizes attention maps in multimodal LLMs, yielding better perception and grounding than text-rationale-based RL methods.", "motivation": "Existing RL post-training for LLMs focuses on generating long rationales to improve reasoning via test-time scaling. When applied to multimodal LLMs, this approach underperforms on perception-heavy tasks and may even hurt accuracy, indicating a mismatch between optimizing output tokens and the true need for better visual grounding and information selection.", "method": "The authors propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient reinforcement learning framework that treats the model\u2019s internal attention distributions as actions/policies. Instead of reinforcing particular output sequences, RAL optimizes where the model attends within multimodal inputs (images, video frames, text) based on task rewards. They also develop On-Policy Attention Distillation, which transfers learned attention behaviors from an RL-trained policy to a student model by aligning latent attention patterns rather than just output tokens.", "result": "Across a range of image and video benchmarks, models trained with RAL outperform those trained with GRPO and other RL or post-training baselines. The gains are consistent, indicating more effective visual grounding and cross-modal information use. On-Policy Attention Distillation further improves cross-modal alignment and yields better downstream performance than conventional knowledge distillation focused on output distributions.", "conclusion": "Optimizing attention policies directly is an effective and principled alternative to output-based RL post-training for multimodal LLMs. By learning where to attend rather than what explanations to generate, RAL improves perception, grounding, and cross-modal alignment, suggesting a promising direction for scaling multimodal reasoning and understanding in future MLLMs."}}
