Pilot study. Data, prompts, and code available at https://osf.io/dc24t/", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. \"Whale\" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (<1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores using a betting-style prediction market interface to elicit confidence-calibrated forecasts from LLMs when they evaluate other LLMs, finding that wager size strongly reflects prediction confidence and modestly improves accuracy.", "motivation": "LLMs are widely used to evaluate other models, but their judgments are usually binary and lack explicit, calibrated confidence measures. This limits their utility for risk-sensitive applications and meta-evaluation, where knowing how sure the model is can be as important as the prediction itself. The authors want a lightweight protocol that turns LLM evaluators into better-calibrated forecasters whose internal uncertainty becomes observable and machine-usable.", "method": "The authors created 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline LLMs (three newer, three older) answered all questions. Three separate Predictor LLMs were then tasked with forecasting, for each (question, baseline model) pair, whether the baseline\u2019s answer is correct. Each Predictor ran under two conditions: (1) Control \u2013 simply predict correct/incorrect; (2) Incentive \u2013 predict correct/incorrect and place a wager between 1 and 100,000 units of fictional currency (LLMCoin) at even odds, starting from a 1,000,000-coin bankroll. Each condition generated 5,400 forecasts. The authors compared accuracy and learning over four rounds, and analyzed how bet size correlated with correctness as a proxy for confidence calibration.", "result": "Incentive-mode forecasts achieved slightly higher overall accuracy than Control (81.5% vs. 79.1%), but this difference was only marginally significant (p = .089), though with a relatively large effect size (d = 0.86). Incentivized predictors showed substantially greater improvement across rounds (12.0 percentage points vs. 2.9 from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011), indicating faster learning under the betting frame. Crucially, wager size was tightly aligned with correctness: very large bets (\u226540,000 coins) were correct about 99% of the time, while very small bets (<1,000 coins) were correct only ~74% of the time, demonstrating a clear confidence gradient in the predictions.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that embedding LLM evaluations in a betting-style prediction market game does not dramatically boost accuracy on its own, but it does generate a strong, interpretable confidence signal via stake size that is missing from ordinary binary predictions. This simple financial framing can expose LLMs\u2019 internal belief strength in a way that is both legible and useful, potentially enabling more risk-aware forecasting, better meta-evaluation pipelines, and future LLM-to-LLM prediction market architectures. The authors position their protocol as a foundational step toward systematic, confidence-calibrated LLM judgment systems rather than as a finished, accuracy-enhancing technique."}}

Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach.

We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach to model contextual passage utility, accounting for inter-passage dependencies.

To resolve this, we propose FlatFormer, a streamlined architecture based on the novel design paradigm of ``Information Injection over Structural Stacking.'' Unlike parameter-heavy hierarchical models, FlatFormer leverages a standard flat Transformer augmented with two lightweight injection mechanisms: (i) a hybrid input encoding strategy combining learnable session identifiers with fixed sinusoidal step embeddings; and (ii) a pre-computed power-law bias integrated directly into attention logits to explicitly model the forgetting curve. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets (e.g., EdNet, Junyi) show that FlatFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, on the EdNet dataset, compared to the strongest hierarchical baseline (HiTSKT), its absolute AUC increased by 8.3%, while using less than 15% of parameters, and inference speed was about three times faster. These results validate that high cognitive fidelity does not necessitate architectural complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlatFormer is a flat Transformer-based knowledge tracing model that matches or exceeds hierarchical models\u2019 performance while being much smaller and faster, by injecting cognitive information into inputs and attention instead of stacking complex structures.", "motivation": "Existing knowledge tracing models that accurately capture realistic cognitive phenomena like learning sessions and forgetting curves usually rely on deep, hierarchical architectures.

This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%.

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs)--especially block-wise variants--enable parallel generation and intra-block bidirectional reasoning, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly and wastes the knowledge in mature AR checkpoints. Prior \"adaptation\" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to full-sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a block-diffusion recipe, leaving a fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality unaddressed. We reframe adaptation as a intra-paradigm path from AR to Block-Diffusion by viewing AR as Block-Diffusion with blocksize=1. Concretely, we design the pathway of adaptation as follows: we use a context-causal attention mask (causal in context, bidirectional only within the active block), an efficient parallel adaptation procedure, an auxiliary AR loss to maximize data utilization and retain pretrained knowledge, and gradual increment of the generation block size. The recipe integrates cleanly with masked block-diffusion and maintains train-inference consistency. Built on these components, NBDiff-7B (Base and Instruct) could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs, delivering strong gains on general-knowledge, math, and code benchmarks over strong baselines.

However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself.

We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data.

However, temporal reasoning, particularly under complex temporal constraints, remains a major challenge. To this end, existing approaches have explored symbolic methods, which encode temporal structure explicitly, and reflective mechanisms, which revise reasoning errors through multi-step inference. Nonetheless, symbolic approaches often underutilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while reflective methods typically lack structured temporal representations, which can result in inconsistent or hallucinated reasoning. As a result, even when the correct temporal context is available, LLMs may still misinterpret or misapply time-related information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that integrates structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance the temporal sensitivity of LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification, and corrects flawed inferences using abductive reflection. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal question answering benchmarks demonstrate that NeSTR achieves superior zero-shot performance and consistently improves temporal reasoning without any fine-tuning, showcasing the advantage of neuro-symbolic integration in enhancing temporal understanding in large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeSTR is a neuro-symbolic framework that improves LLM temporal reasoning by combining explicit symbolic time representations with reflective, abductive error correction, achieving strong zero-shot results without fine-tuning.", "motivation": "Although LLMs perform well on many NLP tasks, they struggle with temporal reasoning, especially when multiple, interdependent temporal constraints are involved.

First, temporal relations in the input are encoded symbolically to preserve structure. Then, LLM inferences are guided and constrained by this structure. A verification component checks logical consistency of the temporal reasoning against the symbolic representation. When inconsistencies or errors are detected, an abductive reflection module prompts the LLM to revisit and revise its reasoning, using the symbolic constraints as guidance. This loop of symbolic encoding, verification, and abductive correction is applied in a zero-shot setting, without task-specific fine-tuning.", "result": "On multiple temporal question answering benchmarks, NeSTR outperforms baseline LLMs and prior temporal reasoning methods in zero-shot scenarios.

Specifically, based on prompts derived from data context, decision tree specifications and output requirements, TreeED queries the LLM to induce the decision tree skeleton, whose root-to-leaf decision paths specify the stepwise procedure for evaluating a given sample. Each tree contains three types of nodes: (1) rule nodes that perform simple validation checks (e.g., format or range), (2) Graph Neural Network (GNN) nodes that capture complex patterns (e.g., functional dependencies), and (3) leaf nodes that output the final decision types (error or clean).

We modify the original model by adding statistical controls for spatial and phylogenetic dependencies between languages. The new results show that most of the previously observed patterns are not robust, and in fact many patterns disappear completely when adding the genealogical and areal controls. A small number of patterns, however, emerges as highly stable even with the new sample. Through the new analysis, we are able to assess the distribution of sound symbolism on a larger scale than previously. The study further highlights the need for testing all universal claims on language for robustness on various levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "Most previously claimed universal sound-symbolic patterns in basic vocabulary vanish once genealogical and areal relatedness among languages are properly controlled, though a few robust patterns remain.", "motivation": "Prior studies reported universal links between sounds and meanings in basic vocabulary, but they often used relatively small, biased language samples and failed to control for genealogical (family) and areal (geographic) dependencies. This raises concerns that apparent universal sound symbolism might instead reflect inheritance or contact patterns rather than true cross-linguistic universals. The paper aims to rigorously test the robustness and reproducibility of these claims using better data and models.", "method": "The authors reanalyze a recent influential study on sound symbolism in basic vocabulary. They greatly expand the language sample from 245 to 2864 languages using Lexibank. They modify the original statistical model to incorporate controls for spatial (areal) and phylogenetic (genealogical) dependencies among languages, allowing them to estimate whether phonological over-representations truly exceed what would be expected from shared history and contact. They then compare which previously reported sound\u2013meaning associations survive under the new, more conservative modelling framework.", "result": "When genealogical and areal controls are introduced, most of the sound-symbolic patterns reported in the earlier study lose statistical support; many disappear entirely. Only a relatively small subset of patterns remain significant and appear highly stable across the enlarged, controlled sample of 2864 languages. This indicates that much of the earlier evidence for universal sound symbolism was likely driven by sample composition and failure to control for non-independence of languages.", "conclusion": "Universal claims about sound symbolism in basic vocabulary must be treated cautiously unless they are tested with large, diverse samples and models that control for genealogical and areal dependencies. Many purported universal sound\u2013meaning correspondences do not hold up under such scrutiny, though some robust patterns do exist. More broadly, the study underscores the need to routinely assess the robustness and reproducibility of universal claims in linguistics using appropriate statistical and sampling controls."}}

A classical issue with the fusion of many embeddings from audio with text is the large length of the audio sequence compared to the text one. Our method benefits from an existing speech tokenizer trained for Audio Speech Recognition that output long sequences of tokens from a large vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate it at low cost in a large language model. By applying a simple lasso-based feature selection on multimodal Bag-of-Words representation, we retain only the most important audio tokens for the task, and adapt the language model to them with a self-supervised language modeling objective, before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. We show this helps to improve the performances compared to an unimodal model, to a bigger SpeechLM or to integrating audio via a learned representation. We show the effectiveness of our method on two recent Argumentative Fallacy Detection and Classification tasks where the use of audio was believed counterproductive, reaching state-of-the-art results.

Carefully selected discrete speech tokens (and even randomly chosen ones) can enhance performance on argumentation-related tasks that were previously thought to be harmed by audio.

Our approach employs synthetic reasoning tasks with explicit atomic operations, parseable step-by-step reasoning traces, and systematic manipulation of training distributions. We evaluate models along two axes: extrapolative generalization to more complex compositions and contextual generalization across surface contexts. Using this framework, we reconcile competing views on RL's effectiveness. We show that: 1) RL produces true capability gains (pass@128) only when pre-training leaves sufficient headroom and when RL data target the model's edge of competence, tasks at the boundary that are difficult but not yet out of reach. 2) Contextual generalization requires minimal yet sufficient pre-training exposure, after which RL can reliably transfer. 3) Mid-training significantly enhances performance under fixed compute compared with RL only, demonstrating its central but underexplored role in training pipelines. 4) Process-level rewards reduce reward hacking and improve reasoning fidelity. Together, these results clarify the interplay between pre-training, mid-training, and RL, offering a foundation for understanding and improving reasoning LM training strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper builds a controlled experimental framework to disentangle how pre-training, mid-training, and RL-based post-training each contribute to language model reasoning, showing when and how RL yields genuine capability gains.", "motivation": "It is unclear whether reinforcement learning post-training truly extends language model reasoning beyond what was already learned during pre-training, largely because modern training pipelines lack control and transparency about data, intermediate stages, and interactions among objectives. The authors want to causally isolate and measure the distinct contributions of pre-training, mid-training, and RL so that claims about reasoning improvements are on a firmer empirical footing.", "method": "The authors construct a synthetic experimental setup using reasoning tasks defined by explicit atomic operations and fully parseable step-by-step traces. They carefully control and vary pre-training, mid-training, and RL training distributions, then evaluate models on extrapolative generalization to more complex compositions and contextual generalization to new surface forms. They compare regimes with and without mid-training, with and without RL, and with different reward types, including process-level rewards, to see how each stage causally affects reasoning capabilities and generalization.", "result": "The experiments show that (1) RL yields genuine capability gains in pass@128 only when pre-training leaves enough headroom and RL targets tasks at the model's competence frontier; (2) a small but adequate amount of pre-training exposure is sufficient for robust contextual generalization via RL; (3) mid-training leads to much better performance under fixed compute than using RL alone, underscoring mid-training's importance; and (4) process-level rewards mitigate reward hacking and enhance the faithfulness of reasoning steps.", "conclusion": "The work demonstrates that reasoning improvements from RL are conditional on pre-training headroom and task targeting, that contextual generalization benefits from modest pre-training combined with RL, and that mid-training is a crucial but overlooked component for improving reasoning under compute constraints. Process-level rewards further improve reliability. Overall, the paper offers a clear, controlled view of how pre-training, mid-training, and RL interact, providing guidance for designing more effective reasoning-oriented LM training pipelines."}}

Previous work assessing LLMs' generalisation performance, however, typically focuses on a single out-of-distribution dataset. This approach may fail to precisely evaluate the capabilities of the model, as the data shifts encountered once a model is deployed are much more diverse. In this work, we investigate whether OOD generalisation results generalise. More specifically, we evaluate a model's performance across multiple OOD testsets throughout a finetuning run; we then evaluate the partial correlation of performances across these testsets, regressing out in-domain performance. This allows us to assess how correlated are generalisation performances once in-domain performance is controlled for. Analysing OLMo2 and OPT, we observe no overarching trend in generalisation results: the existence of a positive or negative correlation between any two OOD testsets depends strongly on the specific choice of model analysed.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies whether generalisation results of large language models on one OOD dataset transfer to other OOD datasets, and finds that they generally do not in a consistent way.", "motivation": "Practitioners often rely on a small number of out-of-distribution benchmarks to estimate how well an LLM will generalise after deployment. However, real-world data shifts are diverse, and prior work usually tests on only a single OOD dataset, which may misrepresent true robustness. The authors want to know if success (or failure) on one OOD benchmark is predictive of performance on others, once basic in-domain competence is accounted for.", "method": "They track model performance on multiple OOD test sets over the course of a finetuning run. For each pair of OOD datasets, they compute the partial correlation between performances across training checkpoints while regressing out the model\u2019s in-domain performance. This isolates how similarly the model generalises across OOD datasets beyond what is explained by its general in-domain ability. They apply this procedure to specific LLM families, OLMo2 and OPT.", "result": "The partial correlations between different OOD test sets vary in sign and magnitude and depend heavily on the specific model examined. There is no consistent pattern showing that strong generalisation to one OOD dataset reliably predicts strong (or weak) generalisation to another OOD dataset once in-domain performance is controlled for.", "conclusion": "OOD generalisation performance itself does not robustly generalise across datasets: the relationship between different OOD benchmarks is model-dependent and inconsistent. Therefore, evaluating an LLM on a single or small set of OOD datasets can give a misleading picture of its real-world robustness, and a broader, more diverse evaluation suite is needed."}}
