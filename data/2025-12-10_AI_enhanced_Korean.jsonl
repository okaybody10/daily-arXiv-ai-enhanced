Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uce21\uc774

While existing embedding models address the first two constraints, they underperform on information retrieval in specialized domains like finance. This paper introduces a scalable pipeline that trains specialized models from an unlabeled corpus using a general purpose retrieval embedding model as foundation. Our method yields an average of 27.7% improvement in MRR$\\texttt{@}$5, 44.6% improvement in mean DCG$\\texttt{@}$5 across 14 financial filing types measured over 21,800 query-document pairs, and improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench. We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model. Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration. The methodology provides a cost-effective solution to bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without requiring labor-intensive human annotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad50\uc0ac\ub85c \uc0bc\uc544, \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae08\uc735 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub9d0\ubb49\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud654 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529(\ubc14\uc774\uc778\ucf54\ub354) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae08\uc735 \ubb38\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac70\ub300 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc4f0\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ud06c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uae08\uc735 \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ucc3e\uc544\uc8fc\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9(\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc8c) \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \uc88b\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub77c\ubca8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud06c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubc94\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub77c\ubca8 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c, \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uac80\uc0c9\uae30\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "1) \ubc94\uc6a9 \uac80\uc0c9\uc6a9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378(\uad50\uc0ac, bi-encoder)\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. 2) \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae08\uc735 \uacf5\uc2dc \ubb38\uc11c \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c, \uad50\uc0ac \ubc0f \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ucffc\ub9ac\u2013\ubb38\uc11c \uc30d\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc591\uc131/\uc74c\uc131 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc44\uad74\ud55c\ub2e4. 3) LLM\uc774 \ucffc\ub9ac\u2013\ubb38\uc11c \uc30d\uc758 \uad00\ub828\ub3c4\ub97c \ud310\ubcc4\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\ud615 \uac80\uc0c9\uae30(\ud559\uc0dd bi-encoder)\uc5d0 \uc99d\ub958\ud55c\ub2e4. 4) \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc18\ubcf5(iteration)\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \u2018\ud604\uc7ac \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uac80\uc0c9\u2192\uc774 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ud559\uc0dd\uc744 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5\u2019\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. 5) \uc774\ub807\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud559\uc0dd bi-encoder\ub97c RAG\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4(\uc0dd\uc131 LLM \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4).", "result": "14\uac00\uc9c0 \uae08\uc735 \uacf5\uc2dc \uc720\ud615, 21,800\uac1c \ucffc\ub9ac\u2013\ubb38\uc11c \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 MRR@5\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0 27.7% \ud5a5\uc0c1, mean DCG@5\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0 44.6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c FinanceBench \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 4\uac1c \ubb38\uc11c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc911 3\uac1c\uc5d0\uc11c NDCG\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ub300\ube44 \uae08\uc735 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc640 \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529, LLM \ud310\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574, \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud588\ub2e4. \ud559\uc0dd\u2013\uad50\uc0ac \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \ud558\ub4dc \uc608\uc81c \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae08\uc735 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubc94\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud2b9\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4."}}

Prior approaches typically rely on end-to-end training tied to a specific language or dataset, which limits their generality. In contrast, our method Segment, Embed, and Align (SEA) provides a single framework that works across multiple languages and domains. SEA leverages two pretrained models: the first to segment a video frame sequence into individual signs and the second to embed the video clip of each sign into a shared latent space with text. Alignment is subsequently performed with a lightweight dynamic programming procedure that runs efficiently on CPUs within a minute, even for hour-long episodes. SEA is flexible and can adapt to a wide range of scenarios, utilizing resources from small lexicons to large continuous corpora. Experiments on four sign language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art alignment performance, highlighting the potential of SEA to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing.

Prior work typically optimizes task- or model-specific triggers, making results difficult to compare and limiting transferability. We study universal adversarial suffixes: short token sequences (4-10 tokens) that, when appended to any input, broadly reduce accuracy across tasks and models. Our approach learns the suffix in a differentiable \"soft\" form using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and then discretizes it for inference. Training maximizes calibrated cross-entropy on the label region while masking gold tokens to prevent trivial leakage, with entropy regularization to avoid collapse. A single suffix trained on one model transfers effectively to others, consistently lowering both accuracy and calibrated confidence. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, paraphrase detection, commonsense QA, and physical reasoning with Qwen2-1.5B, Phi-1.5, and TinyLlama-1.1B demonstrate consistent attack effectiveness and transfer across tasks and model families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc798 \ud1b5\ud558\ub294 \u2018\ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac(\ubb38\uc7a5 \ub05d \uc9e7\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5f4)\u2019\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud574, \uc81c\ub85c/\ud4e8\uc0f7 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ub5a8\uc5b4\ub728\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uacfc\uc81c\ub098 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574, \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\u00b7\uacfc\uc81c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\uc774\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ub3c4 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\ub7f0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4(\uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158)\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294\uc9c0\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ubd99\uc5ec\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \u2018\ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\u2019\uc774\uace0 \uc9e7\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc6a9 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \ub610 \uc774\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "1) \uc785\ub825 \ub4a4\uc5d0 \ubd99\ub294 \uc9e7\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5f4(4\u201310 \ud1a0\ud070)\uc744 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4. 2) \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc774\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 Gumbel-Softmax \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \u2018soft\u2019 \ud1a0\ud070 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. 3) \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ub77c\ubca8 \ub2e8\uc5b4(\ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc601\uc5ed)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \uad50\ucc28 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc815\ub2f5 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub0ae\ucd94\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub54c \uc815\ub2f5 \ud1a0\ud070\uc740 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\ud574 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\uac00 \uc815\ub2f5 \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \uc720\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud3b8\ubc95\uc744 \ub9c9\ub294\ub2e4. 4) \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub85c \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac \ud1a0\ud070 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ud55c\ub450 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \ubd95\uad34\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778(\ub35c \ud2b9\uc218\ud55c) \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. 5) \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ub05d\ub09c \ud6c4 soft \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud655\ub960\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud1a0\ud070\ub4e4\ub85c \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud574, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "- \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(\uac10\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860, \ud328\ub7ec\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988 \uac80\ucd9c, \uc0c1\uc2dd QA, \ubb3c\ub9ac \ucd94\ub860)\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378(Qwen2-1.5B, Phi-1.5, TinyLlama-1.1B)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\uac00 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud06c\uac8c \ub0ae\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. -

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 A* \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc124\uacc4(DOD)\uc640 \uac1d\uccb4 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc124\uacc4(OOD)\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c/\uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\ud574, \uce90\uc2dc \ud65c\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uc131\ub2a5 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c DOD\uac00 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0\ucf54\uc5b4 CPU \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uba54\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \uc18d\ub3c4\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub290\ub824, CPU\uc640 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac04 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uce90\uc2dc \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uce5c\ud654\uc801 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 OOD\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, DOD\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294\uc9c0 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "A* \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ud588\ub2e4: \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc OOD(ST-OOD), \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc DOD(ST-DOD), \uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc OOD(MT-OOD), \uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc DOD(MT-DOD). \uac01 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9, CPU \uce90\uc2dc \ubbf8\uc2a4, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ucf5c \ud69f\uc218 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud574 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uce90\uc2dc \ud65c\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uacfc \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \uad00\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc911\uc810\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0b4\ud3c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c DOD \uad6c\ud604(MT-DOD)\uc740 MT-OOD\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub354 \uc9e7\uace0, \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ucf5c \uc218\uc640 \uce90\uc2dc \ubbf8\uc2a4 \ud69f\uc218\uac00 \uc801\uc5b4 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud588\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 OOD\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc774\ub098 \ube44\uc728 \uae30\ubc18(cache miss rate) \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d\uac04 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\ub3c4 \uc788\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DOD\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc774 \ub354 \ub69c\ub837\ud558\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c A*\ucc98\ub7fc \uc791\uc5c5 \ub2e8\uc704\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c(fine-grained) \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \uad00\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ucee4\uc838 \ub450 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \uad6c\ud604\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ub098\uc654\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DOD\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uce90\uc2dc \ubbf8\uc2a4 \uac10\uc18c, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95 \ub4f1 \ud575\uc2ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801 AI \ubc0f \ubcd1\ub82c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 DOD\uac00 \ub354 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ub808\ub529\uc740 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc774 \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \ucabc\uac1c\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \uad00\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc624\ud788\ub824 \uc5ed\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4, \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654\uc758 \uc774\ub4dd\uacfc \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uba74\ubc00\ud788 \ub530\uc838 \uc124\uacc4\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Rewards are shaped using calibrated cross-entropy, removing label bias and aggregating across surface forms to improve transferability.

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801 AI \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uba85\uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\uccb4\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \u2018\uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5d0\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\ud2b8\u2019 \ube44\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\ub9ac(E-DW, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub808\uc774\ud06c, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ub4f1)\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc838 \uc778\ub825 \uc911\uc2ec \uc6b4\uc601\uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub800\uace0, AI\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \uba38\ubb3c\ub7ec \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc AI\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\u00b7\uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc601\uc5ed\uae4c\uc9c0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uba74\uc11c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud0dd \uc804\uccb4\ub97c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc640 \uae30\ud68c\uac00 \uc0dd\uacbc\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad6c\ud604 \ub17c\ubb38\uc774\ub77c\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube44\uc804/\ud3ec\uc9c0\uc154\ub2dd \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uac00\uae5d\ub2e4.

This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \\textbf{SkipKV}, a \\textbf{\\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \\textit{eviction} and \\textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \\textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\\mathbf{26.7}\\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\\mathbf{1.6}\\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\\mathbf{1.7}\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uccb4\uc778-\uc624\ube0c-\uc3d8\ud2b8(CoT) \ucd94\ub860 \uc911 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubb38\uc7a5 \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95 SkipKV\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc740 CoT \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uae34 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c KV \uce90\uc2dc\uac00 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud574 \uc120\ud615 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9(throughput) \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud574 \uc2e4\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 KV \uce90\uc2dc \ucd95\uc18c/\uc0ad\uc81c(eviction) \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 CoT \ud658\uacbd, \ud2b9\ud788 \uba40\ud2f0 \ubc30\uce58 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "1) \uae30\uc874 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc0ad\uc81c \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 CoT \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624, \ud2b9\ud788 \uba40\ud2f0 \ubc30\uce58 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub54c \ud1a0\ud070 \ub2e8\uc704 \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131, \ud328\ub529 \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8 KV \uc608\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c, \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub2e8\uc704 \uc0ad\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc7ac\uac80\uc99d \ubc18\ubcf5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4. 2) \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ud559\uc2b5 \uc808\ucc28 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubc14\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c KV \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\ubc95 SkipKV\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future. The system aims to reduce coordinator burden, intelligently broaden the set of trials considered for each patient and guarantee comprehensive auditability of all AI-generated outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI, \ud2b9\ud788 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc784\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud5d8 \ub300\uc0c1\uc790 \uc120\ubcc4\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\u00b7\ubcf4\uc870\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548\uc131 \ub192\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uc790-\uc784\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud5d8 \ub9e4\uce6d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc784\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud5d8 \ucc38\uc5ec \uc801\uaca9 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \uc120\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uc778\ub825\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub418\uba70, \ub193\uce58\ub294 \ud658\uc790\ub3c4 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, \uaddc\uc81c\u00b7\ubcf4\uc548 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\ub3c4 \ub192\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c4\uc740 \uc774\ub7f0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574 \ucf54\ub514\ub124\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud5d8 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \u2018\uc801\uaca9/\ubd80\uc801\uaca9\u2019\uc744 \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc801\uaca9\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uac80\ud1a0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\u00b7\ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc911\uac04 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\u00b7\uc218\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 human-in-the-loop \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548\u00b7\uac10\uc0ac \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc801\uaca9\uc131\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud310\uc815\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \u2018\ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\u2019\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\uba70, \ubd80\uc801\uaca9\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc870\uac74\uc774 \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uba74 \ubbf8\ub798\uc5d0 \uc801\uaca9\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac1c\ub150\uc99d\uba85 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \ud658\uc790-\uc784\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud5d8 \ub9e4\uce6d \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc801\uaca9\uc131 \uc694\uc57d\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucf54\ub514\ub124\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c \uc2b9\uc778\u00b7\uac70\ubd80\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \u2018\uc65c \uc774\ub7f0 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc774 \ub098\uc654\ub294\uc9c0\u2019\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uac80\ud1a0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 AI \uc0b0\ucd9c\ubb3c\uc774 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc800\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \ubc0f LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud658\uc790-\uc784\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud5d8 \ub9e4\uce6d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc120\ubcc4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud6a8\uc728\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740\u00b7\ub354 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc635\uc158\uc744 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc801\uaca9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uac1c\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\ubb34 \ub3c4\uc785 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\u00b7\uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud588\ub2e4."}}

Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words. Our work showcases the relevance of understanding model translation decisions in terms of gender, how this compares to human decisions and that this information should be leveraged to mitigate gender

(English translation assisted by GPT)", "summary": "Recent incidents in certain online games and communities, where anonymity is guaranteed, show that unchecked inappropriate remarks frequently escalate into verbal abuse and even criminal behavior, raising significant social concerns. Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0

While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets.

This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals. We evaluate the approach on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, which mirrors the long-horizon structure of many robotic manipulation and planning tasks.

Expected publication in 2026", "summary": "Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \u2018\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8(empowerment)\u2019\ub77c\ub294 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uba38\uc2e0\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc778\uc9c0\uacfc\ud559\uc740 Causal Bayes Net\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc798 \uc124\uba85\ud574 \uc654\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uacb0\uacfc \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc815\ubcf4\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \u2018\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\u2019 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774 \ub450 \uc804\ud1b5\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub290\ub080\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \u2018\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uc138\uacc4\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\ub294\u2019 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uad00\uacc4\uc784\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc544\ub3d9\uacfc \uc131\uc778\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \uac1c\uc785(intervention)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\ud5d8\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\uac00 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ud560\uc218\ub85d \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub824\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uac00 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uc138\uacc4\ubaa8\ud615 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc544\ub3d9\uacfc \uc131\uc778\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc815\ud669\uc801\u00b7\uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc73c\ub85c, \uc778\uac04(\ud2b9\ud788 \uc544\ub3d9)\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uba38\uc2e0 \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing reviews in this domain either overlook some important tasks, such as synthetic data generation for addressing privacy concerns, or explainable clinical NLP for improved integration and implementation, or fail to mention important methodologies, including retrieval augmented generation and the neural symbolic integration of LLMs and KGs. In light of this, the goal of this tutorial is to provide an introductory overview of the most important sub-areas of a patient- and resource-oriented HealthcareNLP, with three layers of hierarchy: data/resource layer: annotation guidelines, ethical approvals, governance, synthetic data; NLP-Eval layer: NLP tasks such as NER, RE, sentiment analysis, and linking/coding with categorised methods, leading to explainable HealthAI; patients layer: Patient Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE), health literacy, translation, simplification, and summarisation (also NLP tasks), and shared decision-making support. A hands-on session will be included in the tutorial for the audience to use HealthcareNLP applications. The target audience includes NLP practitioners in the healthcare application domain, NLP researchers who are interested in domain applications, healthcare researchers, and students from NLP fields. The type of tutorial is \"Introductory to CL/NLP topics (HealthcareNLP)\" and the audience does not need prior knowledge to attend this.

However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases.

QSTN enables robust evaluation of questionnaire presentation, prompt perturbations, and response generation methods. Our extensive evaluation ($>40 $ million survey responses) shows that question structure and response generation methods have a significant impact on the alignment of generated survey responses with human answers, and can be obtained for a fraction of the compute cost.

However, recent reasoning models have achieved strong results on graduate-level academic and professional examinations across various disciplines. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning models on a set of mock CFA exams consisting of 980 questions across three Level I exams, two Level II exams, and three Level III exams. Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels.

Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains. On the test set, MOSAIC achieved an overall F1 score of 0.928. Performance was highest in the Rheumatology subset (F1 = 0.962) and strongest for Patient Behavior (e.g., patients asking questions, expressing preferences, or showing assertiveness).

Human writers face time constraints, and extrinsic evaluations can be costly. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential in content creation, concerns about the quality of AI-generated content persist. Traditional evaluation methods, like human surveys, further add operational costs, highlighting the need for efficient, automated solutions. This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations. The study provides critical insights into enhancing LLMs for producing business-aligned, high-quality content, offering significant advancements in automated content generation and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \uc124\ubb38 \uc5c6\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc800\ub834\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \u2018\uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(Generative Agents)\u2019\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ub370 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\uac04 \uc124\ubb38\u00b7\ub9ac\ubdf0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\ub2e4.

We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models. This resource and benchmark establish a foundation for transparent, reproducible, and educationally grounded NLP research in low-resource languages such as Basque.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc14\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5b4 C1 \uc218\uc900 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc5d0\uc138\uc774 \ucc44\uc810(AES)\u00b7\ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc0dd\uc131\uc6a9 \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc, \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc14\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5b4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc5d0\uc138\uc774 \ucc44\uc810 \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%.

Preference-optimization is now a well-researched topic, but previous work has mostly addressed models for English and Chinese. Lower-resource languages lack both datasets written by native speakers and language models capable of generating fluent synthetic data. Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language. Our approach uses an on-policy training method, which we compare with two common approaches: supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning. We conduct a case study on Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l and evaluate fluency through native-speaker assessments. The results show that the on-policy aspect is crucial and outperforms the alternatives without relying on any hard-to-obtain data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc800\uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc720\ucc3d\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\ucc3d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc601\uc5b4\u00b7\uc911\uad6d\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6d0\uc5b4\ubbfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc720\ucc3d\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ub839\ud29c\ub2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc720\ucc3d\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa9\ud45c \uc5b8\uc5b4(\ub178\ub974\uc6e8\uc774\uc5b4 \ubcf4\ud06c\ubab0)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574, \uba85\ub839\ud29c\ub2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774 on-policy \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c(post-training)\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\uacc4\ubc88\uc5ed \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815, \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc720\ucc3d\uc131\uc740 \uc6d0\uc5b4\ubbfc \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c on-policy \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uae30\uacc4\ubc88\uc5ed \ub370\uc774\ud130 SFT \ubc0f \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc88b\uc740 \uc720\ucc3d\uc131\uacfc \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud76c\uadc0\ud55c \ud2b9\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c, \ube44\uc720\ucc3d\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 on-policy \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc720\ucc3d\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc88\uc5ed \uae30\ubc18\u00b7\ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4."}}

Accepted to the ACL ARR July", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc791\uc740 \ud50c\ub798\ub108 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ucf1c, \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0bd\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5b4\ub5a4 LLM\uc774\ub4e0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(RLM)\ub85c \ubc14\uafb8\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95(rSIM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc740 RL \uae30\ubc18 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uae30\ubc18\uc131, \uae4a\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub4f1 \u2018aha\u2019\uc2dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc3d8\uce20 \uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uac8c \ub420 \ub54c \ud6e8\uc52c \uac15\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7f0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\u00b7\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ub9de\ucdb0\uc838 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \uaf42\uc544 \uc4f8 \uc218 \uc788\uace0, \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud574 RLM \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub9ac\ub354-\ud314\ub85c\uc6cc \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc791\uc740 \ud50c\ub798\ub108(\ub9ac\ub354 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ubb38\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uacfc LLM\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc778 CoT\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud574, \uc5b8\uc81c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5(\uc608: \uc790\uae30\ubc18\uc131, \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \ubd84\ud574, \uac80\uc99d \uc694\uccad \ub4f1)\uc744 \uc4f8\uc9c0 \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.

We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d LLM\uc744 \uc815\ub82c(alignment)\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ub82c \ud488\uc9c8 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 RLHF \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \uc804\uc81c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8(\ubb38\ud654, \uc870\uc9c1, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uadf8\ub8f9)\uc758 \uc0c1\uc774\ud55c \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6d0\ucc9c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc \ubd88\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud574\uc57c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc804\uccb4 \uc815\ub82c \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uac00 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc81c\uae30\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc774 \ub85c\uceec\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1(reward)\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc11c\ubc84\ub294 \uc6d0\ucc9c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc774 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc218\uc900 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c (1) min, max, average\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, (2) \uac01 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uacfc\uac70 \uc815\ub82c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c PPO \uae30\ubc18 RLHF \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 Q/A \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\u00b7\ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc9c8\uc758\uc751\ub2f5(Q/A) \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc21c min/max/average \uc9d1\uacc4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4, \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ub82c \uc810\uc218(\ub2f5\ubcc0 \ud488\uc9c8\u00b7\uc120\ud638 \uc77c\uce58\ub3c4)\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5f0\ud569\ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc778\uad6c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c LLM \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c, \ub2e8\uc21c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uade0\uc774\ub098 \uadf9\ub2e8\uac12 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uacfc\uac70 \uc815\ub82c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9d1\uacc4\uac00 \ub354 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc6d0\uc8fc\uc758\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uac8c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c LLM\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Also available on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17530868", "summary": "The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\u00fcrkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks.

Also available on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17533851", "summary": "Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types. The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models. Ultimately, this research contributes to more efficient and reliable construction practices by enhancing the prediction of soil compaction parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac74\uc124 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1a0\uc9c8 \ub2e4\uc9d0\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud568\uc218\ube44(OMC)\uc640 \ucd5c\ub300\uac74\uc870\ubc00\ub3c4(MDD)\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AutoML\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\uc911 XGBoost\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 OMC\uc640 MDD \uacb0\uc815\uc740 \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ub2e4\uc9d0 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc778\ub825\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0, \ud68c\uadc0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud1a0\uc9c8 \uc885\ub958\uac00 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uba74 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70 \uc801\uc6a9 \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc AI/ML \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1a0\uc9c8\uc774 \uc11e\uc778 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\uce58 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud574 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ubc94\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ud1a0\uc9c8 \uc720\ud615\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c \ub4a4, AutoML \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c ML \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc640 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c OMC\uc640 MDD\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, AutoML\uc774 \uc120\ud0dd\u00b7\ud29c\ub2dd\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "AutoML \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uac80\uc99d\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c MDD \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uacc4\uc218(R\u00b2)\ub294 80.4%, OMC \uc608\uce21\uc758 R\u00b2\ub294 89.1%\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \ub2e8\uc21c \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc218\uce58\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AutoML\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ud1a0\uc9c8 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 OMC\uc640 MDD\ub97c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 XGBoost\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ub2e4\uc9d0 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud1a0\ubaa9\u00b7\uac74\uc124 \ud604\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc9d0 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uacb0\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

An In-Depth Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Gradually growing the depth of Transformers during training can not only reduce training cost but also lead to improved reasoning performance, as shown by MIDAS (Saunshi et al., 2024). Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csord\u00e1s et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks.

The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 GNN\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 XAI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 GNN \uc124\uba85 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ud6c4\uc801 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uc73c\uba70, \uc790\uccb4 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubc94\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc608\uce21 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 XAI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud53c\ucc98 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d GNN \uc124\uba85 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 GNN\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 GNN\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub354 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\ud6c4\uc801/\uc790\uccb4 \ud574\uc11d \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.",

This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled \"sociological sandbox\". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with \"toxic\" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this \"latency of toxicity\" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline.

Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on five tasks while maintaining comparable performance on the remaining tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc0dd\uccb4\uc2e0\ud638\uc6a9 \ud2b9\uc131(feature)\uc744 LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\ucf54\ub529\u00b7\uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c DeepFeature\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 AUROC\ub97c \ud3c9\uade0 4~10% \uc815\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uae30\uae30\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5bb\ub294 \uc0dd\uccb4\uc2e0\ud638(\uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4, PPG \ub4f1)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 ML \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131(feature)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0\ub370 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \ud639\uc740 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc740 \u2460 \uacfc\uc5c5(\uc9c8\ubcd1, \uc608\uce21\ubaa9\ud45c \ub4f1) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \u2461 \uc870\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc774\ub77c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, \u2462 \uc790\ub3d9 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uae68\uc9c0\uae30 \uc27d\ub2e4\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\ud615\uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud65c\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574, \uacfc\uc5c5 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ub3cc\uc544\uac00\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "DeepFeature\ub77c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains. This framework represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, providing engineers with concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub09c\ub958 \uc720\ub3d9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc94\uc6a9 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c

Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the \"Semantic Trap\" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc218\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\ud658 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\u00b7\uc218\ub9ac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870(DTG)\uc640 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 APR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud568\uc218 \ub2e8\uc704 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub808\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc218\ub9ac(APR)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub514\ub809\ud130\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ubc1c\ubaa9 \uc7a1\ud600 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 Code Property Graph(CPG)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc774\ub77c \ubc84\uadf8\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778(\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\ubbf8\u00b7\uacc4\uc57d \uc704\ubc18)\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, RAG \uae30\ubc18 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc870\uac01\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \uac00\uc838\uc640 \u2018\uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud568\uc815(Semantic Trap)\u2019\uc5d0 \ube60\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\u00b7\uacc4\uc57d\u00b7\uacc4\ud1b5(lineage)\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub450\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "(1) Code Property Graph\uc640 \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \u2018\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0c1\ud0dc\u2019\ub97c \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c, \uc774 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub4e4\uc744 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ud568\uc218/\uba54\uc11c\ub4dc\ub97c \uc5e3\uc9c0\ub85c \ub450\ub294 Data Transformation Graph(DTG)\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c\uc368 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc804\uccb4\ub97c \u2018\ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\u00b7\ubcc0\ud658\u00b7\uc804\ub2ec\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\u2019\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uacc4\ud1b5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.

To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud734\ub300\uc6a9 \ub9ac\ud2ac\uc774\uc628 \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac\uc758 SOH(\uc0c1\ud0dc\uac74\uac15\ub3c4)\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc4f8 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \ub9cc\ud07c \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc804\uc774\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95(CITL)\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\u00b7\uace0\uc18d \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9ac\ud2ac\uc774\uc628 \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ud734\ub300\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c\u00b7UAV \uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac \uc0c1\ud0dc(SOH)\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ucd94\uc815\ud574\uc57c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uc548\uc804 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc804\uc774\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 SOH \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\ub3d9 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\uc774 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uc740 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \uc791\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 SOH \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc800\uc790\ub294 \u2018\uad6c\uc131\uc801 \uc810\uc9c4 \uc804\uc774\ud559\uc2b5(Constructive Incremental Transfer Learning, CITL)\u2019\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc804\uc774\ud559\uc2b5 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. 1) \ud0c0\uae43 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \ube44\ub77c\ubca8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4(supervised+unsupervised) \uc804\uc774 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud574, \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc794\ucc28\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uac00(constructive incremental)\ud55c\ub2e4. 2) \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(SRM), \uc804\uc774 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec \ucc28\uc774 \ucd95\uc18c), \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654(\uc6d0\ubcf8\u00b7\ud0c0\uae43\uc758 \uae30\uc800 \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874)\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud574, \uc0c8\ub85c \ucd94\uac00\ub418\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uac00 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. 3) \uc81c\uc548\ud55c CITL\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec TL \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc18c\ud615\uc131(compactness)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\uc2ed \ud68c \ube44\ud589 \ubbf8\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c UAV \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c CITL\uc740 \uae30\uc874 SOH \uc804\uc774\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95(SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, AS^3LSTM)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 RMSE \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uac01\uac01 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, 57.34%\uc758 \uc624\ucc28 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec, \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6e8\uc52c \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\uc815 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CITL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc804\uc774\ud559\uc2b5 SOH \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c\u00b7UAV\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc801\uc740 \ud0c0\uae43 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub77c\ubca8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ube44\ub77c\ubca8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc18c\ud615\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c\uc368 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\ub3d9 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \ud734\ub300\uc6a9 \ub9ac\ud2ac\uc774\uc628 \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Manually specifying ethical rules is labour-intensive and highly context-specific. We present Principles2Plan, an interactive research prototype demonstrating how a human and a Large Language Model (LLM) can collaborate to produce context-sensitive ethical rules and guide automated planning. A domain expert provides the planning domain, problem details, and relevant high-level principles such as beneficence and privacy.

The development of large language mod-3 els (LLMs) enables the automated generation of4 heuristics. Existing LLM-based evolutionary meth-5 ods rely on population strategies and are prone6 to local optima. Integrating LLMs with Monte7 Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improves the trade-off8 between exploration and exploitation, but multi-9 round cognitive integration remains limited and10 search diversity is constrained. To overcome these11 limitations, this paper proposes a novel cognitive-12 guided MCTS framework (CogMCTS). CogMCTS13 tightly integrates the cognitive guidance mecha-14 nism of LLMs with MCTS to achieve efficient au-15 tomated heuristic optimization. The framework16 employs multi-round cognitive feedback to incor-17 porate historical experience, node information, and18 negative outcomes, dynamically improving heuris-19 tic generation. Dual-track node expansion com-20 bined with elite heuristic management balances the21 exploration of diverse heuristics and the exploita-22 tion of high-quality experience. In addition, strate-23 gic mutation modifies the heuristic forms and pa-24 rameters to further enhance the diversity of the so-25 lution and the overall optimization performance.26 The experimental results indicate that CogMCTS27 outperforms existing LLM-based AHD methods in28 stability, efficiency, and solution quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uacfc \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 CogMCTS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud574, \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uacfc \ud574\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4(AHD) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uac1c\uccb4\uad70 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574, \uad6d\uc18c \ucd5c\uc801\ud574\uc5d0 \ube60\uc9c0\uae30 \uc27d\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\u2011\ud65c\uc6a9 \uade0\ud615\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.

In this work, we introduce the novel Embodied Smartphone Operation (ESO) task and present See-Control, a framework that enables smartphone operation via direct physical interaction with a low-DoF robotic arm, offering a platform-agnostic solution. See-Control comprises three key components: (1) an ESO benchmark with 155 tasks and corresponding evaluation metrics; (2) an MLLM-based embodied agent that generates robotic control commands without requiring ADB or system back-end access; and (3) a richly annotated dataset of operation episodes, offering valuable resources for future research.

This paper proposes a new paradigm of \"human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement,\" aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible \"functional white-box\" system through structured \"meta-interaction.\" The core breakthrough lies in the \"plug-and-play cognitive framework\"--a computable knowledge package that can be extracted from expert dialogues and loaded into the Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN). This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from \"AI as a tool\" to \"AI as a thinking partner.\" This work not only provides the first engineering proof for \"cognitive equity\" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through \"transparency of interaction protocols\" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models.

While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM)\uc5d0 \u2018\uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\u2019\uc744 \uc6d0\ucc9c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c GUI \uc870\uc791, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub4f1\uc740 \uc798\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc0dd\uae38 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uc774 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud55c\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\uba74 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcf4\uc644\ud574\uc57c \ud560\uc9c0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\uc758\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "41\uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825(\uc774\ud574, \uacc4\ud68d, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc18c\ud1b5, \uc801\uc751)\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uad6c\uc131, \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c/\ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud560\uc9c0 \uac1c\ub150\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub77c\ub3c4 \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4. \uc989, \u2018\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud06c\uba74 \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ub3c4 \uc800\uc808\ub85c \uc0dd\uae34\ub2e4\u2019\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \uc131\ub9bd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0b0\ubb3c\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\u00b7\uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc774\ud574\u00b7\uacc4\ud68d\u00b7\ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\u00b7\uc801\uc751 \ub124 \ucd95\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \ud3c9\uac00, \ud559\uc2b5, \uc548\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uacb0\ub860\uc9d3\ub294\ub2e4."}}

When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb34\uc778\uae30(UAV)\uc5d0 \ud0d1\uc7ac\ub41c \uacf5\uc911 RIS\uc640 STAR-RIS\uc758 3\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb34\uc120 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "6G\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc640 \uc6a9\ub7c9 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 RIS\uc640 STAR-RIS\uac00 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ud2b9\ud788 UAV\uc5d0 \ud0d1\uc7ac\ub41c \uacf5\uc911 \uad6c\uc870\ubb3c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ub450 \uad6c\uc870 \uac04\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\uc640 \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc30\uce58 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc548\ud14c\ub098 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacf5\uc911 \ucc44\ub110 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, UAV\uc758 \uace0\ub3c4\uc640 \uc790\uc138(\ubc29\ud5a5)\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 AI(Agentic AI) \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\uad6c\ud604\u00b7\uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb34 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uc77c LLM \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub85c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\uc2a4\ud15d \uc5c5\ubb34, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc5f0\ub3d9, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uc0b0\uc5c5\uacc4\uc640 \uc5f0\uad6c\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 AI \ub3c4\uc785\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ub298\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\u00b7\ub3c4\uad6c\u00b7\uc678\ubd80 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubb36\uc5b4 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ub355\uc158\uae09 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\uc6b4\uc601\ud560\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ub77c\uc774\ud504\uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 (1) \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574, (2) \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4 \ud328\ud134, (3) MCP(Model Context Protocol) \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569, (4) \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc124\uacc4, (5) \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 AI(Responsible-AI) \uace0\ub824, (6) \ud658\uacbd \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c MCP \uae30\ubc18 \ud234 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc124\uacc4, \uc21c\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ud615 \ud234 \ud638\ucd9c, \ub2e8\uc77c \ucc45\uc784 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc678\ubd80\ud654, \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\uc18c\uc2dc\uc5c4 \uc124\uacc4, \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \ub85c\uc9c1\uacfc MCP \uc11c\ubc84 \ubd84\ub9ac, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc30\ud3ec, KISS \uc6d0\uce59 \ub4f1 9\uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubca0\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub799\ud2f0\uc2a4\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub274\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\u00b7\uad6c\ud604\ud574 \uc81c\uc548 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub77c\uc774\ud504\uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uacfc 9\uac00\uc9c0 \ubca0\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub799\ud2f0\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc218 LLM\u00b7\ub3c4\uad6c\u00b7\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158, \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \uc6a9\uc774\uc131, \uc548\uc804\u00b7\uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uad6c\uc131, MCP \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc124\uacc4, \ubc30\ud3ec \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 AI\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud2b9\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ub3c4\uad6c, \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ud504\ub85c\ub355\uc158 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc2e4\ubb34 \ubca0\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub799\ud2f0\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \ucc45\uc784\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ucc38\uace0\uc11c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARLoS\ub294 \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 LoRA\ub97c \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\u00b7\uac80\uc0c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LoRA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131\ud615 \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3ed\ubc1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub298\uc5b4\ub098\uba74\uc11c, \uc5b4\ub5a4 LoRA\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801/\uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\ub294\uc9c0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc801\uc5b4 \ub454 \uc124\uba85\uc774\ub098 \ub2e4\uc6b4\ub85c\ub4dc \uc218 \uac19\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \uc778\uae30\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9\u00b7\ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c LoRA\uc758 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud574 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub123\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\u00b7\ubd84\ub958\u00b7\ubc95\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "650\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 LoRA\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2dc\ub4dc \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub4a4, \uac01 LoRA\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uae30\ubcf8(base) \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c CLIP \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub54c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uac01 LoRA\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud574 \ud45c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.

While many benchmarks have been developed to assess agent performance, most concentrate on academic settings or artificially designed scenarios while overlooking the challenges that arise in real applications. To address this issue, we focus on a highly practical real-world setting, the e-commerce domain, which involves a large volume of diverse user interactions, dynamic market conditions, and tasks directly tied to real decision-making processes. To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration.

Preprint", "summary": "We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MLLM\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\u00b7\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\u00b7\ud63c\ud569 \uc785\ub825 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uae30\ub294 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c REST/REST+ \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uac19\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9cc \ubc14\uafd4 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\uc744 \ub54c\ub3c4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac19\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uac19\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \uc904 \ub54c\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \uc904 \ub54c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7f0 \u2018\uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\u2019\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\u00b7\ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9cc \ubc14\uafb8\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ub2f5\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uad50\ud558\uac8c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uadf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "1) \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8(semantic information)\ub97c \ub2f4\ub418 \ud45c\ud604 \ud615\ud0dc\ub9cc \ub2e4\ub978 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0(\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8+\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud63c\ud569)\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec REST \ubc0f REST+ \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4. 2) 15\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 MLLM\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ubcc4 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. 3) OCR \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\uc81c\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc18d\ub418\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0c9\uc0c1\u00b7\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\u00b7\ud3f0\ud2b8, \ube44\uc804 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218 \ub4f1 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. 4) \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uac04 \u2018\ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac2d\u2019\uacfc \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud574, \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc758 \uae30\uacc4\uc801(\uba54\uce74\ub2c8\uc998 \uad00\uc810) \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "(1) 15\uac1c SOTA MLLM \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c, \uac19\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9cc \ubc14\uafb8\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc815\ub2f5\uc774\ub098 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c\ub2e4.
