We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns.

While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks.

They empirically show that following this oracle order boosts final generation quality. Then they treat unmasking-order selection as a learning-to-rank problem: they train a supervised planner that, given a masked context, predicts an ordering of positions that mimics the oracle ordering induced by Gt-Margin. At inference, this planner is plugged into standard MDLM sampling to choose where to unmask at each step, while leaving the base token prediction model unchanged.", "result": "Using the oracle Gt-Margin unmasking order substantially improves the final text generation quality of MDLMs, with particularly strong gains on logical reasoning benchmarks.

By defining a ground-truth-based margin metric, the authors construct an oracle unmasking schedule that reveals how much unmasking order can matter. They then successfully distill this oracle behavior into a supervised learning-to-rank planner that selects unmasking positions during inference. This approach improves reasoning performance efficiently and modularly, suggesting that better planning over unmasking can be a powerful lever for enhancing MDLM-based text generation without retraining or altering the underlying language model."}}

Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline.

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods.

However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation.

In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model.", "AI": {"tldr": "A unified multi-modal model is proposed that retrieves evidence, verifies claims using both text and images (e.g., charts), and generates natural-language explanations, along with a new AI-domain dataset for scientific claim verification.", "motivation": "Existing claim verification methods mostly focus on textual evidence only and/or ignore explicit explanations, which is problematic for claims that depend on both visual (e.g., charts) and textual information and for applications that require transparent, explainable reasoning.

Additionally, they construct a new scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, containing AI-domain claims paired with chart and text evidence.", "result": "Empirical experiments (details not in the abstract) show that the proposed model outperforms baselines on multi-modal claim verification tasks and is effective at retrieving relevant evidence and generating explanations, including on the newly introduced AIChartClaim dataset.", "conclusion": "Jointly modeling evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation within a single architecture significantly improves both accuracy and transparency of claim verification over text-and-image evidence.

While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions.

Performance degrades further on advanced topics such as quantum security, where accuracy declines to about 73%. On questions with embedded false premises, models often fail to challenge the incorrect assumptions, with accuracy falling below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.", "conclusion": "Quantum-Audit shows that while leading language models can match or even exceed average human expert performance on many quantum computing questions, they still exhibit notable weaknesses. They are less reliable on rigorously crafted expert questions, struggle more with advanced subfields like quantum security, and frequently accept and propagate false premises rather than recognizing and correcting them. This indicates that current LLMs, despite strong surface-level competence, lack robust conceptual understanding and critical reasoning in quantum computing, highlighting the need for improved training and evaluation methods focused on these aspects."}}
