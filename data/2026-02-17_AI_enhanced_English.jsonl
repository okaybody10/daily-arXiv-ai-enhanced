However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels.

We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality.

Unfaithfulness and confabulation (especially genuine topical drift) are detectable via embeddings, and in some cases with robust cross-domain structure. Factual errors, however, are not detectable from embeddings alone because such representations capture distributional co-occurrence rather than ground-truth correspondence. Therefore, embedding-based hallucination detectors are intrinsically limited: they can identify when the model ignores context or drifts semantically, but not whether an in-frame statement is factually correct. Detecting Type III errors requires external knowledge or verification mechanisms beyond distributional embeddings."}}

Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time.

This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors' individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density.

At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.\n  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains. Overall, our findings provide evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes X-Blocks, a hierarchical framework to analyze how humans linguistically explain automated vehicle (AV) behavior across scenarios, using context, syntax, and lexical levels to guide better, trustworthy AV explanations.", "motivation": "Existing AV explanation methods lack a systematic way to study how humans naturally explain driving decisions across diverse situations, which is needed to design explanations that foster user trust, transparency, and cognitive accessibility in safety-critical AV contexts.", "method": "They introduce X-Blocks, a three-level linguistic analysis framework (context, syntax, lexicon).

However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \\benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance. Our work highlights the practical value of ToM as an essential interaction-level mechanism rather than as a standalone reasoning skill.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a new benchmark and training framework to evaluate and improve Theory of Mind capabilities in large language models for resolving mismatches between user beliefs and reality during interaction.", "motivation": "Although LLMs are strong general-purpose assistants, they often fail when user intentions or instructions are vague or based on incorrect beliefs. This creates an epistemic divergence between what the user believes and the actual environment or task state. Existing Theory of Mind evaluations for LLMs mostly test whether a model can infer isolated beliefs in toy settings, and do not measure whether such capabilities help in real, interactive tasks. The paper is motivated by the need to (1) define ToM for LLMs in a way that is grounded in practical interaction, and (2) systematically evaluate and enhance models\u2019 ability to detect and resolve these belief mismatches to improve task success.", "method": "The authors formalize Theory of Mind for LLMs as the capability to detect and resolve epistemic divergence between user beliefs and the true task or environment state. They then propose a benchmark, \\benchname, that evaluates how well models can reconcile user beliefs and user profiles with reality in realistic interaction scenarios, beyond isolated belief inference. They test 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark to characterize current limitations. To improve performance, they construct a trajectory-based ToM dataset where full interaction trajectories link belief tracking (what the user believes over time) with task-related state inference (what is actually true or required for success). A model is then trained on this dataset using reinforcement learning to directly optimize its belief-tracking and ToM behavior in interactive settings.", "result": "Across 11 leading LLMs, the evaluation on \\benchname shows that current models have substantial difficulty identifying and addressing users\u2019 underlying cognitive gaps, even when these gaps block successful task completion. After training on the trajectory-based ToM dataset with reinforcement learning, the enhanced model exhibits consistent improvements in reasoning about user mental states, including better detection of incorrect or incomplete user beliefs and more effective guidance to align those beliefs with the task reality. These gains also translate into improved downstream task performance on the benchmark.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that Theory of Mind for LLMs should be understood and evaluated as an interaction-level mechanism for detecting and resolving epistemic divergence, rather than as a narrow, standalone reasoning puzzle. The proposed \\benchname benchmark and trajectory-based ToM RL training pipeline show that explicitly targeting this interaction-centric ToM leads to measurable gains in both mental-state reasoning and practical task success.

This relies upon a small draft model, tasked with predicting the outputs of the target model. State-of-the-art speculative decoding methods use a draft model consisting of a single decoder layer and output embedding matrix, with the latter dominating drafting time for the latest LMs. Recent work has sought to address this output distribution bottleneck by reducing the vocabulary of the draft model. Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step.

While widely studied for large language models, the optimization of RAG for Small Language Models (SLMs) remains a critical research gap, particularly in complex, multi-hop question-answering tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. In these systems, prompt template design is a crucial yet under-explored factor influencing performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to investigate this factor, evaluating 24 different prompt templates on the HotpotQA dataset.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions.

We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context. These results underscore the importance of prompt structure in retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies how large language models verify facts when given long contexts, showing that their accuracy drops with longer inputs and that evidence is best placed at the beginning or end of the prompt.", "motivation": "Although LLMs can reason well, their performance on long-context tasks is unreliable, and prior work has mostly focused on question answering. There is a need to understand how context length and where evidence appears in the prompt affect LLM-based fact verification, especially for retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems.", "method": "The authors evaluate five open-source LLMs from different model families (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5, Qwen3) and parameter sizes (7B, 32B, 70B) on three fact-verification datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, ClimateFEVER). They measure models\u2019 parametric factual knowledge and systematically vary both total context length and the position of relevant evidence within the context (beginning, middle, end) to observe how these factors affect verification accuracy.", "result": "LLMs show meaningful parametric knowledge of factual claims but their fact-verification accuracy generally decreases as the context length grows. Accuracy is consistently higher when the supporting evidence is placed at the start or end of the prompt and lower when the evidence is located in the middle of the context, reproducing mid-context degradation effects reported in earlier work.", "conclusion": "Context length and evidence placement strongly influence LLM-based fact verification. Because verification performance degrades with longer contexts and when evidence appears mid-prompt, the structure of prompts and retrieval outputs is crucial for designing effective retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems."}}

To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts.

In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success.

We compare five encoder-decoder transformers varying along two dimensions: sequential vs. position-invariant positional encoding, and atomic vs. decomposed tag representations. Positional encoding proves decisive: position-invariant models recover the correct L-shaped paradigm clustering even when L-shaped verbs are scarce in training, whereas sequential positional encoding models only partially capture the pattern. Yet none of the models productively generalize this pattern to novel forms. Position-invariant models generalize the L-shaped stem across subjunctive cells but fail to extend it to the first-person singular indicative, producing a mood-based generalization rather than the L-shaped morphomic pattern.

First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses.

This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is \"Index for locating, not understanding\"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression).

In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage.

For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts.

Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory.

Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \\emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \\textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required.

We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence.

We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (\u0394) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-\u03a9(\u0394/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.\n  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics.

The framework incorporates contextual alignment, consistency checks, and majority agreement, followed by human evaluation to verify label quality. Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation.

This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort.

Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning.

They design scoring methods for each attribute and then selectively mask or suppress the gradients of tokens considered noisy based on these scores during fine-tuning, effectively preventing harmful updates from those tokens.", "result": "Across three downstream domains (math, code, and medicine) and seven mainstream LLMs, integrating XTF into the fine-tuning pipeline yields consistent gains over standard fine-tuning, with improvements reported up to 13.7% in downstream performance metrics.

By decomposing token contributions into interpretable attributes and filtering noisy tokens via gradient masking, XTF improves performance and provides explanatory insight into how different tokens influence training.

This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism.

By directly targeting the residual paths with simple attenuation or gating, the authors can steer representations toward better output alignment, improving performance with minimal architectural changes. This suggests that paying attention to input-output alignment in residual connections is an effective and general way to enhance LLMs trained with next-token prediction."}}

Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space.

To bridge this gap, we propose the \"ForesightSafety Bench\" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks.

Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference.

To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms.

To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion.

Overall, MAC-AMP achieves more balanced and optimized AMP candidates across these molecular properties than comparison methods.", "conclusion": "MAC-AMP demonstrates that a closed-loop, multi-agent LLM-based system with simulated peer review and adaptive reinforcement learning can effectively handle multi-objective AMP design in a more interpretable way than black-box models. The approach not only improves performance over existing AMP generators on key molecular properties but also offers a flexible, explainable framework that can potentially be transferred to other complex scientific and molecular design tasks, contributing a new paradigm for AI-assisted drug discovery under multi-objective constraints."}}

Khan", "Asim Mehmood", "Sandra Zilles"], "title": "On the Semantics of Primary Cause in Hybrid Dynamic Domains", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper defines and analyzes what it means for an event to be an actual (primary) cause in systems where actions produce both discrete and continuous change, using a hybrid temporal situation calculus framework, and shows two formal definitions are equivalent and well-behaved.", "motivation": "Existing formal theories of actual causation are mostly designed for purely discrete systems and do not handle hybrid domains where actions can cause both discrete transitions and continuous change over time. However, many real-world reasoning tasks about responsibility, explanation, and rational action occur in such hybrid settings. The authors aim to extend formal accounts of actual causation to a hybrid action-theoretic framework so that causal reasoning can be done rigorously in these more realistic domains.", "method": "They work within the hybrid temporal situation calculus, a logical framework for representing actions that yield both discrete and continuous effects. Within this framework, they introduce two candidate definitions of \"primary cause\": (1) a foundational, theory-driven definition grounded in the structure of hybrid action theories, and (2) a contribution-based definition that characterizes causation in terms of how an event contributes to an effect, verified via a modified counterfactual \"but-for\" test adapted to hybrid dynamics. They then formally prove that these two definitions coincide (are equivalent) and analyze which properties of causation they satisfy.", "result": "The main results are: (i) two formal, precise definitions of primary cause are given for hybrid temporal situation calculus theories, one foundational and one contribution-based; (ii) a proof that these two definitions are equivalent, ensuring that different intuitions about causation align in this framework; and (iii) a demonstration that the resulting notion of causation satisfies a range of intuitively desirable properties (although the abstract does not list them explicitly).", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that actual causation can be coherently and rigorously defined in hybrid action domains using the hybrid temporal situation calculus. The two proposed definitions\u2014foundational and contribution-based with a modified but-for test\u2014are shown to be equivalent and to exhibit intuitively reasonable properties, thereby providing a solid basis for causal reasoning in settings with both discrete and continuous change."}}

Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface \"under-the-radar\" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.\n  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets).
