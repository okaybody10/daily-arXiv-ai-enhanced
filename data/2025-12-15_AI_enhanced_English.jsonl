The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps.

The gains hold across a wide range of compute budgets, indicating that the framework not only improves raw performance but also makes better use of limited inference-time resources.

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

Empirical analysis confirms that no tested baseline both effectively removes information and avoids highly OOD image sequences; there is a trade-off where improving one property worsens the other. The proposed feature-visualization-based, model-dependent baseline achieves a better balance on this trade-off, yielding sequences that are less OOD while still removing enough information, and thus providing more consistent and reliable fidelity evaluations across attribution methods.", "conclusion": "Baseline choice is a critical, often overlooked factor in the evaluation of attribution methods using fidelity metrics such as Insertion and Deletion. Existing baselines either fail to remove sufficient information or produce out-of-distribution artifacts, causing biased and sometimes contradictory judgments about which attribution method is superior.

Speculative decoding mitigates this issue by leveraging a smaller draft model to predict candidate tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, existing approaches often require additional training, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or prior analysis of models and tasks before deployment. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a hyperparameter-free decoding scheme that dynamically adjusts generation length and acceptance criteria during inference. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one to determine when to stop candidate token generation and another to decide token acceptance, both updated in real time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This approach eliminates the need for pre-analysis or fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf models.

As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "They propose a new training framework that makes the whole RAG pipeline behave like an interactive proof system so LLMs only answer when supported by retrieved evidence and learn to reject or ignore misleading context.", "motivation": "Current RAG systems treat retrieved documents as loose hints; LLMs often hallucinate, answer without sufficient support, or latch onto spurious evidence, and evaluation of faithfulness is confounded by model prediction errors.", "method": "They adapt the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) interactive proof protocol to RAG: the generator LLM (Arthur) is trained with two retrieval agents\u2014Merlin, which supplies helpful evidence, and Morgana, which injects adversarial misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify the most influential evidence spans and modify them. Training encourages Arthur to (1) answer only when context supports the answer, (2) abstain when evidence is insufficient, and (3) base predictions on the specific supporting spans. They also design an evaluation framework separating explanation fidelity from base prediction errors and define Explained Information Fraction (EIF) based on M/A-certified mutual information, normalized by model capacity and benchmark noise.", "result": "On three RAG datasets and two LLM families, models trained with the M/A framework show better groundedness, completeness, soundness, and rejection behavior, with fewer hallucinations, all without needing labels for unanswerable questions. The retriever also gains higher recall and MRR using automatically generated hard positives and negatives from the M/A process.", "conclusion": "Training RAG systems as autonomous interactive-proof-style pipelines, where retrieved evidence is treated as verifiable proof rather than a suggestion, yields more reliable, faithful, and effective RAG models, improving both generator and retriever in a principled, annotation-efficient way."}}

The paper is currently under peer review", "summary": "Extracting coherent and human-understandable themes from large collections of unstructured historical newspaper archives presents significant challenges due to topic evolution, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) noise, and the sheer volume of text. Traditional topic-modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often fall short in capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of discourse in historical texts. To address these limitations, we employ BERTopic. This neural topic-modeling approach leverages transformerbased embeddings to extract and classify topics, which, despite its growing popularity, still remains underused in historical research. Our study focuses on articles published between 1955 and 2018, specifically examining discourse on nuclear power and nuclear safety. We analyze various topic distributions across the corpus and trace their temporal evolution to uncover long-term trends and shifts in public discourse. This enables us to more accurately explore patterns in public discourse, including the co-occurrence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons and their shifts in topic importance over time. Our study demonstrates the scalability and contextual sensitivity of BERTopic as an alternative to traditional approaches, offering richer insights into historical discourses extracted from newspaper archives. These findings contribute to historical, nuclear, and social-science research while reflecting on current limitations and proposing potential directions for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper uses BERTopic, a transformer-based neural topic model, to analyze how newspaper discourse about nuclear power and safety evolved from 1955 to 2018, showing that it captures nuanced, time-varying themes better than traditional methods like LDA.", "motivation": "Historical newspaper archives are massive, noisy (e.g., OCR errors), and contain evolving topics over time, making it hard to extract clear, human-interpretable themes.

It scales to a large archive and remains sensitive to contextual nuances that traditional models would likely miss.", "conclusion": "BERTopic is a scalable and context-aware alternative to classical topic models for historical newspaper analysis, yielding richer insights into long-term shifts in public discourse on nuclear issues. The study underscores its value for historical, nuclear, and social-science research, and it points out current limitations and directions for improving topic modeling in historical corpora."}}

Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "They propose a lightweight, model-agnostic method (DBSA) to quantify how sensitive a black-box LLM\u2019s output distribution is to each input token, enabling practical auditing and interpretability for high-stakes applications.", "motivation": "Existing LLM auditing tools mostly test narrow properties (e.g., bias, fairness) and often assume access to model internals.

However, the fundamental limits on the achievable speedup remain poorly understood. In this work, we establish the first ``tight'' lower bounds on the runtime of any deterministic speculative generation algorithm. This is achieved by drawing a parallel between the token generation process and branching random walks, which allows us to analyze the optimal draft tree selection problem. We prove, under basic assumptions, that the expected number of tokens successfully predicted per speculative iteration is bounded as $\\mathbb{E}[X] \\leq (\u03bc+ \u03bc_{(2)})\\log(P )/\u03bc^2 + O(1)$, where $P$ is the verifier's capacity, $\u03bc$ is the expected entropy of the verifier's output distribution, and $\u03bc_{(2)}$ is the expected second log-moment.
