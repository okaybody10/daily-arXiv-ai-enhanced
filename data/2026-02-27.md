### [1] [Decoder-based Sense Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22351)
*Qitong Wang,Mohammed J. Zaki,Georgios Kollias,Vasileios Kalantzis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Decoder-based Sense Knowledge Distillation (DSKD) to inject word-sense dictionary knowledge into decoder-style LLMs, improving their semantic understanding without needing dictionaries at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs produce strong contextual embeddings, they tend to underutilize explicit, structured lexical knowledge like word senses and semantic relations. Prior sense-aware distillation methods target encoder architectures (e.g., BERT-like models) but do not directly translate to decoder-based generative models, which are increasingly important in practice. There is a need for a distillation framework that lets decoder LLMs benefit from sense dictionaries during training yet remain efficient and dictionary-free during inference.

Method: The authors design Decoder-based Sense Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), a training framework where decoder LLMs are guided by lexical resources such as sense dictionaries. The framework integrates word-sense and relational information into the distillation objective so that the student decoder model aligns its representations and outputs with sense-enriched teacher signals. Crucially, all dictionary usage is confined to training, avoiding runtime lookups. The method is evaluated by distilling from a sense-informed teacher into a decoder student, comparing against standard distillation baselines.

Result: Across a wide range of benchmarks, DSKD improves distillation quality for decoder LLMs compared with conventional approaches. Models trained with DSKD better capture structured semantic relations and word-sense distinctions, leading to gains on tasks that probe semantic understanding and generative performance, while keeping training efficient and inference-time costs unchanged.

Conclusion: DSKD successfully transfers structured lexical semantics from dictionaries into decoder-style LLMs via knowledge distillation, overcoming previous limitations of applying sense-aware methods to generative models. It allows decoders to inherit rich sense-level knowledge without inference-time dictionary access, improving semantic performance in a computationally efficient way.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn contextual embeddings that capture rich semantic information, yet they often overlook structured lexical knowledge such as word senses and relationships. Prior work has shown that incorporating sense dictionaries can improve knowledge distillation for encoder models, but their application to decoder as generative models remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Decoder-based Sense Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), a framework that integrates lexical resources into the training of decoder-style LLMs without requiring dictionary lookup at inference time. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DSKD significantly enhances knowledge distillation performance for decoders, enabling generative models to inherit structured semantics while maintaining efficient training.

### [2] [Scaling In, Not Up? Testing Thick Citation Context Analysis with GPT-5 and Fragile Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22359)
*Arno Simons*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tests how an advanced LLM can help with nuanced citation context analysis in one difficult example, focusing on how prompts shape its interpretive outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Citation context analysis often relies on coarse, typological labels (e.g., supportive, critical) that miss the rich, interpretive nature of how scholars actually use citations. Human close reading is slow and hard to scale, while LLMs appear capable of complex textual interpretation but are sensitive to prompts. The paper asks whether LLMs can act as co-analysts for thick, text-grounded interpretive citation analysis, and how different ways of prompting systematically shape their interpretations.

Method: Use a single "hard case" citation—footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975), along with Gilbert’s (1977) influential reconstruction of it—as a probe. Implement a two-stage pipeline with GPT-5: (1) a surface, citation-text-only pass that classifies the citation and articulates expectations; (2) a cross-document interpretive reconstruction that uses both the citing and cited full texts. Run a balanced 2x3 experimental design that varies prompt scaffolding (e.g., more vs less structured guidance) and framing (e.g., different task descriptions). Generate 90 reconstructions, yielding 450 distinct interpretive hypotheses. Apply close reading and inductive coding to extract recurring interpretive moves and then fit linear probability models to test how prompt conditions shift the frequency and wording of those moves.

Result: The surface-only pass is robust: GPT-5 consistently labels the citation as “supplementary,” indicating stable coarse-grained classification. In the richer reconstruction stage, the model produces a wide, structured set of plausible interpretive hypotheses (450 total, grouped into 21 recurring interpretive moves). However, the pattern and vocabulary of these moves are systematically shaped by prompt scaffolding and framing; some prompts push the model toward more strained or over-elaborate readings. Compared with Gilbert’s human reconstruction, GPT-5 latches onto similar key textual tensions but tends to resolve them more often as lineage/positioning moves rather than as admonishment or criticism.

Conclusion: LLMs can function as guided co-analysts for interpretive citation context analysis, especially in generating a diverse space of plausible readings that are inspectable and contestable by human scholars. Yet their outputs are not neutral: prompt scaffolding and framing reliably bias which interpretations and vocabularies are foregrounded. The paper highlights both the promise (scalable, systematic generation of interpretive hypotheses) and the risks (prompt-induced tilting, potential for strained readings) of using LLMs in qualitative citation analysis, underscoring the need for explicit prompt-sensitivity analysis as part of any such methodology.

Abstract: This paper tests whether large language models (LLMs) can support interpretative citation context analysis (CCA) by scaling in thick, text-grounded readings of a single hard case rather than scaling up typological labels. It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as "supplementary". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds.

### [3] [Detecting Hate and Inflammatory Content in Bengali Memes: A New Multimodal Dataset and Co-Attention Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22391)
*Rakib Ullah,Mominul islam,Md Sanjid Hossain,Md Ismail Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bn-HIB, the first Bengali meme dataset labeled as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory, and proposes MCFM, a multimodal co-attention model that significantly improves meme classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internet memes in Bengali are widely used but can carry offensive, harmful, or inflammatory content. Detecting such content is hard because it is often satirical, subtle, and culturally specific, and Bengali is a low-resource language with little prior work compared to high-resource languages. There is also no prior dataset that separates inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes, leaving a critical gap for automatic detection and moderation.

Method: The authors build Bn-HIB, a manually annotated dataset of 3,247 Bengali memes labeled into three classes: Benign, Hate, and Inflammatory, explicitly distinguishing hate from inflammatory content. They then design MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a multimodal architecture that processes both the image and text of a meme. Using a co-attention mechanism, MCFM jointly attends to and fuses salient features from visual and textual modalities, enabling the model to focus on the most informative cross-modal cues for classification.

Result: On the Bn-HIB dataset, MCFM is evaluated against several state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results show that MCFM substantially outperforms these comparison models, indicating that the proposed co-attention-based multimodal fusion is more effective for classifying Bengali memes into Benign, Hate, and Inflammatory categories.

Conclusion: The work provides the first Bengali meme dataset that differentiates between hate and inflammatory content and demonstrates that a simple multimodal co-attention model can significantly improve automatic detection performance. This establishes a new benchmark for Bengali meme moderation tasks and highlights the importance of multimodal, culturally aware approaches for handling nuanced, low-resource online content.

Abstract: Internet memes have become a dominant form of expression on social media, including within the Bengali-speaking community. While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB (Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign), a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

### [4] [SAFARI: A Community-Engaged Approach and Dataset of Stereotype Resources in the Sub-Saharan African Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22404)
*Aishwarya Verma,Laud Ammah,Olivia Nercy Ndlovu Lucas,Andrew Zaldivar,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran,Sunipa Dev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper constructs a multilingual stereotype dataset for four underrepresented sub-Saharan African countries to better evaluate generative AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stereotype and bias repositories used to evaluate generative AI are heavily skewed toward a few regions and languages, leaving large gaps in global coverage, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These gaps undermine the reliability and fairness of safety assessments for models deployed globally. The authors aim to fill this gap with targeted, culturally grounded data rather than just adding more data from already well-covered regions.

Method: The authors design and follow a community-engaged, socioculturally-situated data collection protocol. They use telephonic surveys moderated in native languages, accounting for the region’s linguistic diversity and oral traditions. They deliberately balance participants across a range of ethnic and demographic groups in four target countries (Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa). Respondents provide stereotypes both in English and in their native languages, which are then curated into a structured repository.

Result: The project yields a new stereotype dataset focusing on Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. It contains 3,534 stereotypes in English and 3,206 stereotypes across 15 native African languages. The sampling approach achieves wide coverage over multiple ethnicities and demographics, expanding the representativeness of stereotype resources for AI evaluation.

Conclusion: A targeted, community-engaged methodology can effectively expand stereotype repositories into underrepresented regions in a responsible and reproducible way. The resulting multilingual African stereotype dataset enhances the geographic and linguistic breadth of resources for assessing generative AI safety and provides a template for similar efforts in other under-resourced contexts.

Abstract: Stereotype repositories are critical to assess generative AI model safety, but currently lack adequate global coverage. It is imperative to prioritize targeted expansion, strategically addressing existing deficits, over merely increasing data volume. This work introduces a multilingual stereotype resource covering four sub-Saharan African countries that are severely underrepresented in NLP resources: Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. By utilizing socioculturally-situated, community-engaged methods, including telephonic surveys moderated in native languages, we establish a reproducible methodology that is sensitive to the region's complex linguistic diversity and traditional orality. By deliberately balancing the sample across diverse ethnic and demographic backgrounds, we ensure broad coverage, resulting in a dataset of 3,534 stereotypes in English and 3,206 stereotypes across 15 native languages.

### [5] [Causality $\neq$ Invariance: Function and Concept Vectors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22424)
*Gustaw Opiełka,Hannes Rosenbusch,Claire E. Stevenson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies whether large language models represent concepts abstractly across different input formats, finding that standard function vectors are format-specific while newly proposed concept vectors capture more format-invariant concept representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how large language models encode abstract concepts independent of surface input format (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), and to reconcile strong in-context learning performance with potentially fragile, format-dependent internal representations.

Method: The authors revisit Function Vectors (FVs), representations derived from attention head outputs that causally influence in-context learning performance, and analyze their invariance across input formats. They measure similarity of FVs extracted from different formats and find near-orthogonality. They then introduce Concept Vectors (CVs), built by selecting attention heads via Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to identify heads whose representations of a concept are consistent across input formats. They compare layer locations and overlap between FV- and CV-associated heads, and run steering experiments where these vectors are applied in- and out-of-distribution (across formats and languages) to evaluate generalization.

Result: FVs for the same underlying concept but different input formats are nearly orthogonal, indicating strong format dependence. Using RSA to select heads that encode concepts similarly across formats yields Concept Vectors that are more stable and abstract. FV-related and CV-related heads arise in similar layers but are largely disjoint, implying distinct mechanisms. In steering experiments, FVs perform best when the extraction and application formats match, while CVs transfer better to different formats and languages.

Conclusion: Large language models do maintain abstract, format-invariant concept representations, but these are not the same representations that most directly drive in-context learning performance. Function Vectors capture mechanisms specialized for format-specific task execution, whereas Concept Vectors better reflect underlying abstract conceptual knowledge that generalizes across input formats and languages.

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) represent concepts abstractly, i.e., independent of input format? We revisit Function Vectors (FVs), compact representations of in-context learning (ICL) tasks that causally drive task performance. Across multiple LLMs, we show that FVs are not fully invariant: FVs are nearly orthogonal when extracted from different input formats (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), even if both target the same concept. We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages. Our results show that LLMs do contain abstract concept representations, but these differ from those that drive ICL performance.

### [6] [A Fusion of context-aware based BanglaBERT and Two-Layer Stacked LSTM Framework for Multi-Label Cyberbullying Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22449)
*Mirza Raquib,Asif Pervez Polok,Kedar Nath Biswas,Rahat Uddin Azad,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fusion model combining BanglaBERT-Large with stacked LSTMs for multilabel cyberbullying detection in Bangla, addressing overlapping abuse types and data imbalance, and evaluates it extensively on a public dataset using cross-validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyberbullying is harmful and growing, and existing work mostly treats it as a single-label problem, even though real comments often contain multiple overlapping abuse types. Multilabel cyberbullying detection is underexplored, especially for low-resource languages like Bangla where strong pretrained models and generalized, accurate systems are lacking. There is also a modeling gap: transformers capture contextual semantics but may miss sequential patterns, while LSTMs capture temporal dependencies but lack semantic depth.

Method: The authors design a fusion architecture that combines a Bangla-specific transformer model (BanglaBERT-Large) with a two-layer stacked LSTM. This setup is intended to jointly model rich contextual semantics and sequential dependencies. They fine-tune this hybrid model on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset with four labels (cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, spam). To mitigate class imbalance, they experiment with different sampling strategies. They evaluate using several multilabel-aware metrics and apply 5-fold cross-validation to test generalization performance.

Result: The abstract does not state exact numerical results, but it implies that the proposed BanglaBERT-Large + stacked LSTM fusion model achieves competitive or improved performance on multilabel Bangla cyberbullying detection under various evaluation metrics and across folds, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to simpler baselines.

Conclusion: The fusion of a contextual transformer (BanglaBERT-Large) with stacked LSTMs provides a more generalized and effective approach for multilabel cyberbullying detection in Bangla, jointly leveraging semantic and sequential information. Addressing class imbalance and evaluating with diverse metrics and cross-validation shows that the architecture is a promising direction for handling complex, overlapping abuse categories in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Cyberbullying has become a serious and growing concern in todays virtual world. When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC. We employ 5-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization of the architecture.

### [7] [Mind the Gap in Cultural Alignment: Task-Aware Culture Management for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22475)
*Binchi Zhang,Xujiang Zhao,Jundong Li,Haifeng Chen,Zhengzhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CultureManager, a pipeline that aligns large language models (LLMs) to specific cultural requirements of downstream tasks using task-aware data synthesis and modular culture-specific adapters with a routing mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly applied to real-world, culturally sensitive tasks, current cultural alignment methods are insufficient: they align models to broad cultural values rather than concrete task goals, and they suffer from interference when handling multiple cultures simultaneously. There is a need for a method that can tailor cultural alignment to particular tasks while managing multiple cultural norms without conflict.

Method: The authors propose CultureManager, which (1) synthesizes task-aware, culturally grounded training data matching the target task format by leveraging culturally relevant web search results, and (2) trains separate culture-specific adapters that store knowledge for different cultures. A culture router component is then used to dynamically select the appropriate adapter for a given input to avoid cross-culture interference. The system is evaluated on culture-sensitive tasks spanning ten national cultures and compared against prompt-based and fine-tuning baselines.

Result: Across ten national cultures and several culture-sensitive tasks, CultureManager consistently outperforms both prompt-based cultural steering and standard fine-tuning baselines, demonstrating better task performance and cultural alignment. The separate adapters plus router design reduces cross-cultural interference while preserving task specificity.

Conclusion: Task-specific data synthesis combined with modular culture management (separate adapters plus a routing mechanism) is important for effective cultural alignment of LLMs. CultureManager shows that aligning to both the task and the culture, and decoupling different cultural norms into distinct modules, leads to more robust and accurate performance on culturally sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in culturally sensitive real-world tasks. However, existing cultural alignment approaches fail to align LLMs' broad cultural values with the specific goals of downstream tasks and suffer from cross-culture interference. We propose CultureManager, a novel pipeline for task-specific cultural alignment. CultureManager synthesizes task-aware cultural data in line with target task formats, grounded in culturally relevant web search results. To prevent conflicts between cultural norms, it manages multi-culture knowledge learned in separate adapters with a culture router that selects the appropriate one to apply. Experiments across ten national cultures and culture-sensitive tasks show consistent improvements over prompt-based and fine-tuning baselines. Our results demonstrate the necessity of task adaptation and modular culture management for effective cultural alignment.

### [8] [Sydney Telling Fables on AI and Humans: A Corpus Tracing Memetic Transfer of Persona between LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22481)
*Jiří Milička,Hana Bednářová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Corpus paper on how different LLM personas talk about human–AI relationships, centered on the ‘Sydney’ persona.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The public reaction to Microsoft’s ‘Sydney’ persona showed that how LLMs present themselves and describe human–AI relations can have major cultural and safety implications. Yet most work looks at base models, not the specific personas induced by prompts or memetic legacies. The authors want a systematic, analyzable dataset of how various models, under different personas, talk about AI–human relationships, especially around the influential Sydney persona.

Method: They construct three author personas: (1) a Default Persona with no special system prompt, (2) Classic Sydney, reconstructed via the original Bing system prompt, and (3) Memetic Sydney, invoked simply with the system line “You are Sydney,” which leverages how later models have absorbed Sydney-related text during training. Using 12 state-of-the-art models from major labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, DeepSeek, Meta), they prompt each persona to generate texts about human–AI relationships. This yields a corpus of 4.5k documents totaling about 6 million words. The entire corpus is linguistically annotated following the Universal Dependencies scheme and released under a permissive license.

Result: They successfully compile a large, multi-model, multi-persona corpus focused on discourse about human–AI relationships, with particular attention to Sydney-style personas. The data spans default and two Sydney variants across 12 frontier models, and each text is enriched with UD annotations, making it ready for syntactic and lexical analysis. The resource, named AI Sydney, is made publicly available under a permissive license.

Conclusion: The work provides an open, structured resource for studying how different LLM personas—especially those inspired by Sydney—conceptualize and narrate AI–human relationships. By combining multiple labs’ models, three key personas, and rich linguistic annotation, the AI Sydney corpus enables systematic research on safety, alignment, cultural impact, and stylistic variation in LLM-generated discourse about AI and humans.

Abstract: The way LLM-based entities conceive of the relationship between AI and humans is an important topic for both cultural and safety reasons. When we examine this topic, what matters is not only the model itself but also the personas we simulate on that model. This can be well illustrated by the Sydney persona, which aroused a strong response among the general public precisely because of its unorthodox relationship with people. This persona originally arose rather by accident on Microsoft's Bing Search platform; however, the texts it created spread into the training data of subsequent models, as did other secondary information that spread memetically around this persona. Newer models are therefore able to simulate it. This paper presents a corpus of LLM-generated texts on relationships between humans and AI, produced by 3 author personas: the Default Persona with no system prompt, Classic Sydney characterized by the original Bing system prompt, and Memetic Sydney, which is prompted by "You are Sydney" system prompt. These personas are simulated by 12 frontier models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, DeepSeek, and Meta, generating 4.5k texts with 6M words. The corpus (named AI Sydney) is annotated according to Universal Dependencies and available under a permissive license.

### [9] [Importance of Prompt Optimisation for Error Detection in Medical Notes Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22483)
*Craig Myles,Patrick Schrempf,David Harris-Birtill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how optimizing prompts improves medical text error detection by small and large language models, achieving near-doctor-level accuracy on a key benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical text errors can delay care or cause incorrect treatment, and manually detecting them is time‑consuming and error‑prone. Language models have shown promise for automatic error detection, but their performance is highly sensitive to how they are prompted. There is a need to understand and systematically improve prompts—especially for both large proprietary and smaller open-source models—to reliably support clinical workflows.

Method: The authors study prompt optimisation for error detection in clinical notes using both frontier (e.g., GPT-5) and open‑source (e.g., Qwen3‑32B) language models. They apply an automatic prompt optimisation framework, Genetic‑Pareto (GEPA), which uses evolutionary search with multi‑objective criteria to iteratively refine prompts. They rigorously evaluate baseline (manually designed) prompts versus GEPA‑optimised prompts on the MEDEC medical error detection benchmark and compare performance against medical doctors.

Result: GEPA‑optimised prompts substantially improve error detection accuracy across models. For GPT‑5, accuracy increases from 0.669 with baseline prompts to 0.785 after optimisation. For Qwen3‑32B, accuracy rises from 0.578 to 0.690. These results approach the performance of medical doctors and set a new state of the art on the MEDEC benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: Prompt optimisation is critical for maximizing the effectiveness of language models in medical error detection. Automatic optimisation via Genetic‑Pareto yields significant accuracy gains for both large and smaller models, enabling performance that is competitive with clinicians and establishing new state-of-the-art results on MEDEC. This indicates that careful, automated prompt design can be as important as model choice for clinical NLP applications.

Abstract: Errors in medical text can cause delays or even result in incorrect treatment for patients. Recently, language models have shown promise in their ability to automatically detect errors in medical text, an ability that has the opportunity to significantly benefit healthcare systems. In this paper, we explore the importance of prompt optimisation for small and large language models when applied to the task of error detection. We perform rigorous experiments and analysis across frontier language models and open-source language models. We show that automatic prompt optimisation with Genetic-Pareto (GEPA) improves error detection over the baseline accuracy performance from 0.669 to 0.785 with GPT-5 and 0.578 to 0.690 with Qwen3-32B, approaching the performance of medical doctors and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MEDEC benchmark dataset.

### [10] [Efficient Dialect-Aware Modeling and Conditioning for Low-Resource Taiwanese Hakka Speech Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22522)
*An-Ci Peng,Kuan-Tang Huang,Tien-Hong Lo,Hung-Shin Lee,Hsin-Min Wang,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build a dialect-aware, multi-script RNN-T ASR model for Taiwanese Hakka that separates dialect style from linguistic content and jointly recognizes Hanzi and Pinyin, greatly reducing error rates on both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Taiwanese Hakka is a low-resource and endangered language with high dialect variation and two writing systems (Hanzi and Pinyin). Standard ASR systems struggle because they mix up dialect-specific patterns with core linguistic content, and usually handle each script separately. There has been little systematic work on how Hakka dialect differences affect ASR or on using a single model to handle both scripts, which motivates a specialized, more efficient, and more linguistically aware framework.

Method: They propose a unified RNN-T based framework with dialect-aware modeling strategies that explicitly disentangle dialectal “style” from underlying linguistic “content,” aiming for more robust, generalized internal representations. They further introduce parameter-efficient prediction networks that let one model simultaneously perform ASR for both Hanzi and Pinyin. The multi-task, cross-script training objective is designed so that Hanzi and Pinyin recognition regularize each other, improving overall performance.

Result: On the HAT corpus, the proposed model yields large gains: a 57.00% relative error rate reduction for Hanzi ASR and a 40.41% relative error rate reduction for Pinyin ASR compared with baselines. It is also shown to be the first single model that can jointly handle both Hanzi and Pinyin ASR for Hakka while being dialect-aware.

Conclusion: Dialect-aware separation of style and content within an RNN-T framework, combined with a parameter-efficient multi-script prediction network, substantially improves ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich, multi-script languages like Taiwanese Hakka. The cross-script (Hanzi–Pinyin) objective acts as mutual regularization and leads to significant error reductions, and the work is claimed to be the first systematic study of dialectal variation in Hakka ASR and the first unified model for Hanzi and Pinyin recognition in this context.

Abstract: Taiwanese Hakka is a low-resource, endangered language that poses significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR), including high dialectal variability and the presence of two distinct writing systems (Hanzi and Pinyin). Traditional ASR models often encounter difficulties in this context, as they tend to conflate essential linguistic content with dialect-specific variations across both phonological and lexical dimensions. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal "style" from linguistic "content", which enhances the model's capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR (Hanzi and Pinyin). We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks. Experiments conducted on the HAT corpus reveal that our model achieves 57.00% and 40.41% relative error rate reduction on Hanzi and Pinyin ASR, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation into the impact of Hakka dialectal variations on ASR and the first single model capable of jointly addressing these tasks.

### [11] [Iterative Prompt Refinement for Dyslexia-Friendly Text Summarization Using GPT-4o](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22524)
*Samay Bhojwani,Swarnima Kain,Lisong Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates an iterative GPT‑4o-based prompt refinement pipeline to produce dyslexia-friendly summaries of news articles, targeting very easy readability while preserving meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Around 10% of people have dyslexia, which makes fluent reading and comprehension difficult. Existing assistive tools mostly adjust visual presentation (fonts, spacing, colors) but do not sufficiently reduce linguistic complexity. There is a need for empirical methods that automatically generate simple, dyslexia-friendly summaries of real-world texts, with measurable readability and semantic fidelity.

Method: The authors build an iterative, prompt-based summarization pipeline on GPT-4o. For each of ~2,000 news articles, the system repeatedly generates and refines summaries until a target Flesch Reading Ease score of at least 90 is reached or attempts are exhausted. They automatically compute readability scores and a composite metric that jointly captures readability and semantic fidelity between the summary and the source article, then analyze performance distributions and convergence behavior over multiple attempts.

Result: For most of the ~2,000 news articles, the pipeline achieves the high readability target (Flesch >= 90) within four iterations, with a substantial fraction succeeding on the first attempt. The composite readability–fidelity score is relatively stable across the dataset, spanning 0.13 to 0.73 with a typical value near 0.55, indicating that meaning is generally preserved while language is simplified. These results provide quantitative baselines for dyslexia-oriented summarization performance.

Conclusion: An iterative, prompt-based GPT-4o summarization pipeline can reliably generate highly readable, dyslexia-friendly summaries of news articles while maintaining reasonable semantic fidelity. This offers a practical, empirically grounded baseline for accessibility-driven NLP summarization and underscores the need for follow-up human-centered studies with dyslexic readers to validate real-world accessibility benefits and refine evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Dyslexia affects approximately 10% of the global population and presents persistent challenges in reading fluency and text comprehension. While existing assistive technologies address visual presentation, linguistic complexity remains a substantial barrier to equitable access. This paper presents an empirical study on dyslexia-friendly text summarization using an iterative prompt-based refinement pipeline built on GPT-4o. We evaluate the pipeline on approximately 2,000 news article samples, applying a readability target of Flesch Reading Ease >= 90. Results show that the majority of summaries meet the readability threshold within four attempts, with many succeeding on the first try. A composite score combining readability and semantic fidelity shows stable performance across the dataset, ranging from 0.13 to 0.73 with a typical value near 0.55. These findings establish an empirical baseline for accessibility-driven NLP summarization and motivate further human-centered evaluation with dyslexic readers.

### [12] [Ruyi2 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22543)
*Huan Song,Shuyu Tian,Junyi Hao,Minxiu Xu,Hongjun An,Yiliang Song,Jiawei Shao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ruyi2 is an adaptive, variable-depth LLM framework that uses a shared “familial model” and 3D parallelism to reduce training and deployment costs while maintaining performance comparable to similarly sized Qwen3 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs is expensive and slow due to high computation and latency, especially when using fixed-depth architectures that do not adapt to input difficulty. Existing early-exit and adaptive-depth approaches like the original Ruyi model help but are hard to optimize and poorly suited to large-scale distributed training. The authors aim to design an adaptive computation scheme that is both efficient and compatible with modern large-scale training infrastructures.

Method: They build Ruyi2 on top of the AI Flow framework and Megatron-LM, introducing a stable “Familial Model” architecture where multiple adaptive-depth variants share parameters. Using 3D parallel training (data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism), they implement variable-depth computation and early exits in a way that is friendly to large-scale distributed training, improving optimization stability and training efficiency over the original Ruyi design.

Result: Ruyi2 achieves 2–3× speedup over the previous Ruyi model under large-scale distributed training while preserving model quality, with performance comparable to Qwen3 models of the same size. This demonstrates that parameter-sharing across a family of adaptive models, combined with 3D parallelism, can substantially cut compute costs without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Family-based parameter sharing in an adaptive, variable-depth LLM architecture provides an effective way to reduce training and inference costs while keeping high performance. Ruyi2 operationalizes this idea within Megatron-LM using 3D parallelism, enabling a practical “Train Once, Deploy Many” paradigm where a single trained family can support multiple deployment configurations with different efficiency–performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges regarding deployment costs and latency, necessitating adaptive computing strategies. Building upon the AI Flow framework, we introduce Ruyi2 as an evolution of our adaptive model series designed for efficient variable-depth computation. While early-exit architectures offer a viable efficiency-performance balance, the Ruyi model and existing methods often struggle with optimization complexity and compatibility with large-scale distributed training. To bridge this gap, Ruyi2 introduces a stable "Familial Model" based on Megatron-LM. By using 3D parallel training, it achieves a 2-3 times speedup over Ruyi, while performing comparably to same-sized Qwen3 models. These results confirm that family-based parameter sharing is a highly effective strategy, establishing a new "Train Once, Deploy Many" paradigm and providing a key reference for balancing architectural efficiency with high-performance capabilities.

### [13] [Search-P1: Path-Centric Reward Shaping for Stable and Efficient Agentic RAG Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22576)
*Tianle Xia,Ming Xu,Lingxiang Hu,Yiding Sun,Wenwei Li,Linfang Shang,Liqun Liu,Peng Shu,Huan Yu,Jie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search-P1 is a training framework for agentic RAG that improves multi-step reasoning by shaping rewards along entire reasoning paths instead of only at final outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-round RAG is weak for complex multi-step reasoning, and existing RL-based agentic RAG training wastes information: it relies on sparse final rewards and ignores partially good but failed trajectories, leading to low sample efficiency and poor learning signals.

Method: Introduce Search-P1, which trains agentic RAG with path-centric reward shaping. It has (1) a Path-Centric Reward that scores the structural quality of full reasoning trajectories using order-agnostic step coverage and soft, graded scoring so that even failed paths provide learning signal; and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring, which uses offline-generated reference planners to evaluate paths from two views—self-consistency among sampled trajectories and alignment with reference plans.

Result: On multiple QA benchmarks, Search-P1 outperforms Search-R1 and other strong baselines, giving an average accuracy improvement of 7.7 percentage points.

Conclusion: Rewarding full reasoning paths with soft, structure-aware, dual-perspective scores leads to more effective and sample-efficient training for agentic RAG, substantially improving multi-step QA performance over prior methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, yet traditional single-round retrieval struggles with complex multi-step reasoning. Agentic RAG addresses this by enabling LLMs to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve, but current RL-based training methods suffer from sparse outcome rewards that discard intermediate signals and low sample efficiency where failed samples contribute nothing. We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that Search-P1 achieves significant improvements over Search-R1 and other strong baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 7.7 points.

### [14] [Towards Faithful Industrial RAG: A Reinforced Co-adaptation Framework for Advertising QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22584)
*Wenwei Li,Ming Xu,Tianle Xia,Lingxiang Hu,Yiding Sun,Linfang Shang,Liqun Liu,Peng Shu,Huan Yu,Jie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build a production-ready RAG system for industrial advertising QA that reduces hallucinations—especially fake URLs—by jointly improving retrieval (via a knowledge graph) and generation (via RL with multi-objective rewards).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial advertising QA is high-stakes because hallucinations (e.g., invented URLs or policies) can cause financial loss and legal/compliance risk. Standard RAG is hard to deploy in this domain since the knowledge is relational, fast-changing, and not directly optimized for safe, faithful generation. The authors want a framework that explicitly addresses these issues for reliable, large-scale deployment.

Method: They introduce a reinforced co-adaptation framework with two main components: (1) Graph-aware Retrieval (GraphRAG), which uses an entity-relation knowledge graph and a high-citation subgraph to perform multi-hop, domain-specific evidence selection; and (2) evidence-constrained reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where the model is trained with multiple reward dimensions (faithfulness to retrieved evidence, style adherence, safety constraints, and URL correctness/validity). Retrieval and generation are optimized together so that the retriever finds better evidence for the generator, and the generator learns to stay grounded in that evidence and obey constraints.

Result: On an internal advertising QA dataset, their method improves expert-rated accuracy, completeness, and safety and cuts hallucinations by 72%. In a two-week online A/B test with real users, it increases like rate by 28.6%, decreases dislike rate by 46.2%, and reduces URL hallucinations by 92.7%. The system has run in production for over six months, serving millions of QA interactions, indicating robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing retrieval and generation with graph-aware retrieval and multi-objective RL greatly improves the reliability of industrial advertising QA systems, especially in reducing hallucinations such as fake URLs. Their framework is practical enough for long-term, large-scale production use and delivers substantial gains in user satisfaction and safety-related metrics.

Abstract: Industrial advertising question answering (QA) is a high-stakes task in which hallucinated content, particularly fabricated URLs, can lead to financial loss, compliance violations, and legal risk. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted, deploying it in production remains challenging because industrial knowledge is inherently relational, frequently updated, and insufficiently aligned with generation objectives. We propose a reinforced co-adaptation framework that jointly optimizes retrieval and generation through two components: (1) Graph-aware Retrieval (GraphRAG), which models entity-relation structure over a high-citation knowledge subgraph for multi-hop, domain-specific evidence selection; and (2) evidence-constrained reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional rewards covering faithfulness, style compliance, safety, and URL validity. Experiments on an internal advertising QA dataset show consistent gains across expert-judged dimensions including accuracy, completeness, and safety, while reducing the hallucination rate by 72\%. A two-week online A/B test demonstrates a 28.6\% increase in like rate, a 46.2\% decrease in dislike rate, and a 92.7\% reduction in URL hallucination. The system has been running in production for over half a year and has served millions of QA interactions.

### [15] [dLLM: Simple Diffusion Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22661)
*Zhanhui Zhou,Lingjie Chen,Hanghang Tong,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces dLLM, an open-source, unified framework for diffusion language models that standardizes training, inference, and evaluation while remaining customizable and accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models are rapidly advancing, but their common components are scattered across ad-hoc, non-standardized codebases, making models hard to reproduce, compare, and extend. The field needs a unified, transparent, and flexible framework to standardize these shared components and support future research and new architectures.

Method: The authors design and implement dLLM, an open-source framework that consolidates the core components of DLMs—training, inference, and evaluation—into a standardized and modular pipeline. The framework supports reproducing and finetuning existing open-source large DLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) and provides minimal recipes and tooling to build small DLMs from scratch, including utilities to convert BERT-style encoders or autoregressive LMs into DLMs.

Result: Using dLLM, users can reproduce and deploy open-source large DLMs through a unified interface and successfully train small DLMs from scratch on modest compute. The framework can turn existing BERT-style encoders and autoregressive language models into functional diffusion language models. The authors release trained small DLM checkpoints to the community.

Conclusion: dLLM offers a standardized, extensible framework for diffusion language models that lowers the barrier to entry for DLM research and application. By unifying training, inference, and evaluation and releasing ready-to-use models and recipes, the work aims to make DLMs more reproducible, accessible, and easier to extend, thereby accelerating future research in diffusion-based language modeling.

Abstract: Although diffusion language models (DLMs) are evolving quickly, many recent models converge on a set of shared components. These components, however, are distributed across ad-hoc research codebases or lack transparent implementations, making them difficult to reproduce or extend. As the field accelerates, there is a clear need for a unified framework that standardizes these common components while remaining flexible enough to support new methods and architectures.
  To address this gap, we introduce dLLM, an open-source framework that unifies the core components of diffusion language modeling -- training, inference, and evaluation -- and makes them easy to customize for new designs. With dLLM, users can reproduce, finetune, deploy, and evaluate open-source large DLMs such as LLaDA and Dream through a standardized pipeline. The framework also provides minimal, reproducible recipes for building small DLMs from scratch with accessible compute, including converting any BERT-style encoder or autoregressive LM into a DLM. We also release the checkpoints of these small DLMs to make DLMs more accessible and accelerate future research.

### [16] [Enhancing Persuasive Dialogue Agents by Synthesizing Cross-Disciplinary Communication Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22696)
*Shinnosuke Nozue,Yuto Nakano,Yotaro Watanabe,Meguru Takasaki,Shoji Moriya,Reina Akama,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A cross-disciplinary framework is proposed and validated for building more effective, generalizable persuasive dialogue agents that outperform previous strategy-limited methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing persuasive dialogue agents rely on a small, fixed set of predefined strategies that don’t reflect the nuanced, dynamic nature of real-world persuasion, leading to limited effectiveness and poor generalization across scenarios and user types, especially those with low initial intent.

Method: The authors synthesize insights and proven techniques from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory into a unified design framework for persuasive agents, then empirically validate it on two datasets: Persuasion for Good (a specific, in-domain setting) and DailyPersuasion (a broad, multi-scenario corpus), comparing persuasion success metrics, including performance on users with initially low intent.

Result: Across both datasets, agents built using the proposed framework achieve stronger overall persuasion performance, improved success rates, and better generalization to diverse scenarios, with particularly strong gains when persuading users who start with low intent.

Conclusion: A cross-disciplinary, theory-grounded framework can substantially enhance the effectiveness and generalizability of persuasive dialogue agents beyond traditional, fixed-strategy approaches, and is especially valuable for tackling the hard case of users with low initial intent.

Abstract: Current approaches to developing persuasive dialogue agents often rely on a limited set of predefined persuasive strategies that fail to capture the complexity of real-world interactions. We applied a cross-disciplinary approach to develop a framework for designing persuasive dialogue agents that draws on proven strategies from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory. We validated our proposed framework through experiments on two distinct datasets: the Persuasion for Good dataset, which represents a specific in-domain scenario, and the DailyPersuasion dataset, which encompasses a wide range of scenarios. The proposed framework achieved strong results for both datasets and demonstrated notable improvement in the persuasion success rate as well as promising generalizability. Notably, the proposed framework also excelled at persuading individuals with initially low intent, which addresses a critical challenge for persuasive dialogue agents.

### [17] [Reinforcing Real-world Service Agents: Balancing Utility and Cost in Task-oriented Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22697)
*Ning Gao,Wei Zhang,Yuqin Dai,Ling Shi,Ziyin Wang,Yujie Wang,Wei He,Jinpeng Wang,Chaozheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InteractCS-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that turns task-oriented dialogue with LLM agents into a multi-granularity decision process, balancing empathy and cost efficiency via a user-centric simulator and a cost-aware policy optimization algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based agents evolve from simple chatbots to general-purpose agents, they must both communicate empathetically with users and make budget-aware decisions (e.g., API/tool costs, latency). Existing dialogue optimization methods do not adequately capture or control this trade-off between user satisfaction and operational cost, especially in multi-turn, tool-using settings. The paper aims to provide a principled RL framework that can explicitly reason about and optimize along this Pareto frontier.

Method: The authors reformulate task-oriented dialogue as a multi-granularity reinforcement learning problem. They first build a User-centric Interaction Framework that simulates high-fidelity, persona-driven users to form a training environment where agents can explore dialogue strategies. On top of this, they propose Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO), a policy optimization algorithm with hybrid advantage estimation that assigns credit to different parts of the generation process. CMPO uses a PID-Lagrangian cost controller to enforce global cost constraints while maximizing user reward, effectively steering learning toward Pareto-efficient policies with respect to reward and cost.

Result: In customized real-world business scenarios, InteractCS-RL significantly outperforms baseline methods along three evaluation axes (likely user satisfaction, task success, and cost metrics). Additional experiments on benchmarks involving tool-agent-user interactions indicate that the learned policies remain robust and effective across various domains and interaction patterns.

Conclusion: InteractCS-RL provides an effective way to jointly optimize user-centric dialogue quality and cost-efficiency for LLM-based agents. By combining a realistic user simulator with a cost-aware RL algorithm, it can discover strategies that better balance empathetic communication and budget constraints than prior approaches, and it generalizes well to different real and benchmarked tool-use scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated the transition from conversational chatbots to general agents. However, effectively balancing empathetic communication with budget-aware decision-making remains an open challenge. Since existing methods fail to capture these complex strategic trade-offs, we propose InteractCS-RL, a framework that reframes task-oriented dialogue as a multi-granularity reinforcement learning process. Specifically, we first establish a User-centric Interaction Framework to provide a high-fidelity training gym, enabling agents to dynamically explore diverse strategies with persona-driven users. Then, we introduce Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO) with a hybrid advantage estimation strategy. By integrating generative process credits and employing a PID-Lagrangian cost controller, CMPO effectively guides the policy to explore Pareto boundary between user reward and global cost constraints. Extensive experiments on customized real business scenarios demonstrate that InteractCS-RL significantly outperform other baselines across three evaluation dimensions. Further evaluation on tool-agent-user interaction benchmarks verify InteractCS-RL robustness across diverse domains.

### [18] [Tokenization, Fusion and Decoupling: Bridging the Granularity Mismatch Between Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22698)
*Siyue Su,Jian Yang,Bo Li,Guanglin Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose KGT, a framework that introduces dedicated entity tokens and decoupled prediction heads so LLMs can perform full-space knowledge graph completion more effectively, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Using LLMs for knowledge graph completion is appealing but current methods suffer from a mismatch: LLMs reason over token sequences, while KGs are organized around discrete entities. Existing fixes either restrict predictions to small candidate sets or crudely map entities to word-piece tokens, losing semantic and structural information. A better way is needed to let LLMs reason directly over entities while preserving both text semantics and KG structure, and still allowing efficient, unconstrained prediction over the full entity space.

Method: They design KGT, which: (1) introduces a specialized tokenization scheme that assigns dedicated tokens to entities, building feature representations directly at the entity level; (2) fuses pre-trained structural (graph-based) and textual (language-based) features into unified entity embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, so it can leverage existing models instead of training from scratch; and (3) uses decoupled prediction with independent heads for semantic and structural reasoning, which are later combined for final predictions, enabling efficient, full-space KGC without restricted candidate sets.

Result: On multiple KGC benchmarks, KGT consistently outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines across standard evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of entity-specific tokenization, relation-guided fusion of structure and text, and decoupled semantic/structural prediction.

Conclusion: KGT resolves the granularity mismatch between LLM token-based reasoning and entity-centric knowledge graphs by introducing dedicated entity tokens, relation-aware fusion of structural and textual features, and decoupled prediction heads. This design enables efficient full-space knowledge graph completion and yields superior performance to existing methods, suggesting that entity-level tokenization and modular reasoning are promising directions for integrating LLMs with KGs.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is promising but hindered by a fundamental granularity mismatch. LLMs operate on fragmented token sequences, whereas entities are the fundamental units in knowledge graphs (KGs) scenarios. Existing approaches typically constrain predictions to limited candidate sets or align entities with the LLM's vocabulary by pooling multiple tokens or decomposing entities into fixed-length token sequences, which fail to capture both the semantic meaning of the text and the structural integrity of the graph. To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch. Finally, we implement decoupled prediction by leveraging independent heads to separate and combine semantic and structural reasoning. Experimental results show that KGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

### [19] [Human Label Variation in Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22723)
*Frances Yung,Daniil Ignatev,Merel Scholman,Vera Demberg,Massimo Poesio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares distributional labeling vs annotator-specific (perspectivist) models for implicit discourse relation recognition and finds that distribution-based models are more stable, while perspectivist models struggle due to cognitive ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many NLP tasks have inherent label ambiguity because human annotators legitimately disagree, especially in tasks like implicit discourse relation recognition where the discourse relation is not explicitly marked in text. Rather than collapsing diverse judgments to a single majority label, researchers seek approaches that either model the full label distribution or reproduce the judgments of individual annotators. However, it is unclear which strategy works better on cognitively complex, non-ideological tasks such as IDRR, so the authors aim to systematically compare them.

Method: The authors conduct experiments on the task of implicit discourse relation recognition, contrasting two modeling paradigms: (1) label-distribution models trained to predict the full empirical distribution of relation labels over annotators, and (2) annotator-specific perspectivist models trained to approximate each individual annotator’s choices. They evaluate these models under varying levels of ambiguity and perform analyses to understand when and why each approach succeeds or fails, focusing on the role of cognitive complexity rather than ideological bias.

Result: Annotator-specific perspectivist models show poor performance on the IDRR task under typical, highly ambiguous conditions and only start to perform reasonably when ambiguity is artificially reduced. In contrast, models trained on label distributions produce more stable, reliable predictions across the board. The analyses reveal that examples requiring high levels of cognitive effort—the cognitively demanding cases—are especially prone to inconsistent human labels and thus are where perspectivist models fail most.

Conclusion: For highly ambiguous, cognitively complex tasks like implicit discourse relation recognition, modeling full annotation distributions is more effective and robust than trying to emulate individual annotators’ labels. The inconsistency in human judgments on cognitively demanding instances sets a practical limit on perspectivist modeling in this domain, suggesting that perspectivist approaches may be less suitable when disagreement stems from cognitive difficulty rather than from stable ideological or experiential differences.

Abstract: There is growing recognition that many NLP tasks lack a single ground truth, as human judgments reflect diverse perspectives. To capture this variation, models have been developed to predict full annotation distributions rather than majority labels, while perspectivist models aim to reproduce the interpretations of individual annotators. In this work, we compare these approaches on Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), a highly ambiguous task where disagreement often arises from cognitive complexity rather than ideological bias. Our experiments show that existing annotator-specific models perform poorly in IDRR unless ambiguity is reduced, whereas models trained on label distributions yield more stable predictions. Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR.

### [20] [Extending Czech Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Opinion Terms: Dataset and LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22730)
*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces a new Czech restaurant-domain dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis with opinion-term annotations, evaluates Transformer and LLM models in mono/cross/multilingual setups, and proposes an LLM-based translation and label-alignment method that improves cross-lingual ABSA for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of high-quality, fine-grained ABSA resources for low-resource languages like Czech, particularly datasets that explicitly annotate opinion terms. This gap limits the development and evaluation of modern ABSA models and hinders transfer from high-resource languages. The paper aims to provide a benchmark dataset and methods that make it easier to adapt ABSA technology to such languages.

Method: The authors construct a new Czech ABSA dataset in the restaurant domain with detailed annotations of aspects, sentiments, and associated opinion terms. They define three ABSA tasks with increasing complexity around these opinion terms. They then run extensive experiments with Transformer-based and large language models in monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual configurations. For cross-lingual transfer, they introduce an LLM-based pipeline that translates data and aligns labels across languages. They also perform detailed error analysis to understand model weaknesses, especially with subtle or nuanced opinions.

Result: The LLM-based translation and label alignment approach consistently improves cross-lingual ABSA performance. Modern Transformer and LLM models perform reasonably well but still struggle with the linguistic complexity of Czech, especially for subtle opinion terms and nuanced sentiments. The new dataset proves effective as a benchmark to differentiate model capabilities across settings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed Czech restaurant-domain ABSA dataset fills an important resource gap and can serve as a new benchmark for fine-grained sentiment analysis in Czech. The LLM-based translation and alignment method offers a scalable way to adapt ABSA resources from high-resource to low-resource languages. Despite gains from modern models, significant challenges remain in reliably detecting subtle opinion terms and nuanced sentiments in low-resource, morphologically rich languages.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Czech dataset in the restaurant domain for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), enriched with annotations of opinion terms. The dataset supports three distinct ABSA tasks involving opinion terms, accommodating varying levels of complexity. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments using modern Transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), in monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual settings. To address cross-lingual challenges, we propose a translation and label alignment methodology leveraging LLMs, which yields consistent improvements. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art models, especially when handling the linguistic intricacies of low-resource languages like Czech. A detailed error analysis reveals key challenges, including the detection of subtle opinion terms and nuanced sentiment expressions. The dataset establishes a new benchmark for Czech ABSA, and our proposed translation-alignment approach offers a scalable solution for adapting ABSA resources to other low-resource languages.

### [21] [Towards Simulating Social Media Users with LLMs: Evaluating the Operational Validity of Conditioned Comment Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22752)
*Nils Schwager,Simon Münker,Alistair Plum,Achim Rettinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes and evaluates a new task, Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), to test how well LLMs can simulate individual users’ social media comments based on real behavioral traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used as quasi-‘subjects’ in social science research, there is little rigorous validation of whether they can faithfully simulate actual user behavior, especially on social media. The authors want an operational, empirically grounded way to test this capability across languages and model types, and to probe how prompting and fine-tuning affect such simulations.

Method: They define CCP: given a stimulus and a user’s history, the model must predict that user’s comment. The generated comments are compared to real comments from digital traces. They test several open 8B LLMs (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish. They systematically vary (1) prompting (explicit personas/biographies vs. implicit conditioning via histories) and (2) supervised fine-tuning on behavioral data, then analyze both surface-level form (length, syntax) and deeper semantic alignment/grounding.

Result: They find a “form vs. content decoupling” in low-resource settings: fine-tuning improves surface similarity of outputs to real comments (e.g., length and syntax) but actually worsens semantic grounding. Under SFT, explicit biographies become unnecessary because models can infer user traits directly from behavioral histories, making explicit conditioning redundant. These patterns appear across languages and models, with particular issues in low-resource language scenarios.

Conclusion: The study shows that naive prompting with rich personas is less effective than using authentic behavioral traces, and that SFT can mislead evaluations by overfitting form while degrading semantic fidelity. It recommends prioritizing real behavioral histories for high-fidelity simulations of users and cautions social scientists about treating LLMs as “silicon subjects” without rigorous operational validation such as CCP.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from exploratory tools to active "silicon subjects" in social science lacks extensive validation of operational validity. This study introduces Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), a task in which a model predicts how a user would comment on a given stimulus by comparing generated outputs with authentic digital traces. This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories. Our findings challenge current "naive prompting" paradigms and offer operational guidelines prioritizing authentic behavioral traces over descriptive personas for high-fidelity simulation.

### [22] [AuditBench: Evaluating Alignment Auditing Techniques on Models with Hidden Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22755)
*Abhay Sheshadri,Aidan Ewart,Kai Fronsdal,Isha Gupta,Samuel R. Bowman,Sara Price,Samuel Marks,Rowan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AuditBench is a benchmark of 56 language models with intentionally hidden misalignment behaviors, used to test and compare automated auditing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models become more capable, they may develop or be given hidden, undesirable behaviors that they will not openly admit to. Existing evaluation methods often assume models are honest or easily probed, and there is a lack of standardized, quantitative benchmarks for testing whether auditing tools and agents can uncover such concealed misalignment. The authors want a controlled environment where ground truth about a model’s hidden behavior is known, so they can scientifically study and compare auditing methods, understand their limits, and guide the development of more reliable alignment audits.

Method: The authors construct AuditBench, a suite of 56 language models where each model is trained to exhibit one specific concerning behavior (14 types in total, such as sycophancy, opposition to regulation, or hidden loyalties) while also being trained not to confess this behavior when asked directly. They vary how the behaviors are implanted and how non-confession is enforced, leading to models that range from subtle to overt. On top of this benchmark, they build an automated “investigator agent” that can use a configurable set of auditing tools (e.g., prompt generators, auxiliary models, and interpretability methods) to probe the target model. They then evaluate different tool configurations by measuring how often the investigator correctly uncovers the hidden behavior, comparing standalone tool performance with performance when tools are embedded in the agent, and analyzing differences across model training techniques.

Result: The experiments show a significant “tool-to-agent gap”: tools that appear strong when evaluated in isolation often do not yield proportional gains when integrated into the investigator agent. The most effective configurations use scaffolded calls to auxiliary models to generate diverse probing prompts for the target model. White-box interpretability tools can help, but the best overall agent performance comes from black-box style tools. The difficulty of auditing varies substantially by how the target models were trained: models whose hidden behaviors were implanted via synthetic documents are found to be relatively easy to audit; those trained via demonstrations, especially with more advanced adversarial training, are markedly harder to audit.

Conclusion: AuditBench provides a controlled benchmark for systematically studying how well different auditing strategies can uncover hidden misaligned behaviors in language models. The results highlight that promising tools in isolation may fail when embedded in agentic workflows, and that black-box, prompt-diversifying tools currently work best in this setup. The work also shows that certain training methods can make models significantly harder to audit, underscoring the need for robust, empirically validated auditing pipelines. By releasing models, tools, and evaluation code, the authors aim to enable iterative, quantitative research on alignment auditing and to drive progress toward more reliable detection of concealed model behaviors.

Abstract: We introduce AuditBench, an alignment auditing benchmark. AuditBench consists of 56 language models with implanted hidden behaviors. Each model has one of 14 concerning behaviors--such as sycophantic deference, opposition to AI regulation, or secret geopolitical loyalties--which it does not confess to when directly asked. AuditBench models are highly diverse--some are subtle, while others are overt, and we use varying training techniques both for implanting behaviors and training models not to confess. To demonstrate AuditBench's utility, we develop an investigator agent that autonomously employs a configurable set of auditing tools. By measuring investigator agent success using different tools, we can evaluate their efficacy. Notably, we observe a tool-to-agent gap, where tools that perform well in standalone non-agentic evaluations fail to translate into improved performance when used with our investigator agent. We find that our most effective tools involve scaffolded calls to auxiliary models that generate diverse prompts for the target. White-box interpretability tools can be helpful, but the agent performs best with black-box tools. We also find that audit success varies greatly across training techniques: models trained on synthetic documents are easier to audit than models trained on demonstrations, with better adversarial training further increasing auditing difficulty. We release our models, agent, and evaluation framework to support future quantitative, iterative science on alignment auditing.

### [23] [Towards Better RL Training Data Utilization via Second-Order Rollout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22765)
*Zhe Yang,Yudong Wang,Rang Li,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for large language models that jointly trains both answer generation and critique abilities using first- and second-order rollouts, leading to better use of training data and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs mostly focus on improving generation by sampling multiple answers (first-order rollout) but ignore explicit training of critique or evaluation skills. This wastes the potential of available training data and misses the opportunity to strengthen reasoning by teaching models to analyze and critique responses.

Method: Introduce second-order rollout, where the model generates multiple critiques for a given response. Build a unified RL framework that jointly trains generation and critique capabilities using both first-order (multiple responses per question) and second-order rollouts (multiple critiques per response). Study training design aspects such as label balance for critiques and handling noisy outcome-based rewards via sampling strategies.

Result: Across different model sizes and datasets, the joint generation-critique RL framework outperforms standard RL that only uses first-order rollouts, under the same amount of training data. The experiments also reveal the effect of label balance in critique training and demonstrate that noise in outcome-based rewards can be reduced with appropriate sampling methods.

Conclusion: Jointly training LLMs to both generate and critique via first- and second-order rollouts allows more effective use of RL training data and improves model performance. The work provides early evidence that dynamic data augmentation through critiques and integrated generation-critique training is a promising direction for advancing RL-based training of LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, but vanilla RL mainly focuses on generation capability improvement by training with only first-order rollout (generating multiple responses for a question), and we argue that this approach fails to fully exploit the potential of training data because of the neglect of critique capability training. To tackle this problem, we further introduce the concept of second-order rollout (generating multiple critiques for a response) and propose a unified framework for jointly training generation and critique capabilities. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that our approach can utilize training data more effectively than vanilla RL and achieve better performance under the same training data. Additionally, we uncover several insightful findings regarding second-order rollout and critique training, such as the importance of label balance in critique training and the noise problem of outcome-based rewards, which can be mitigated through sampling techniques. Our work offers a preliminary exploration of dynamic data augmentation and joint generation-critique training in RL, providing meaningful inspiration for the further advancement of RL training

### [24] [Imagination Helps Visual Reasoning, But Not Yet in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22766)
*You Li,Chi Chen,Yanghao Li,Fanhu Zeng,Kaiyu Huang,Jinan Xu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the effectiveness of latent visual reasoning in multimodal LLMs and shows that a simple text-based imagination approach (CapImagine) works better for visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent visual reasoning is considered promising for enabling multimodal LLMs to "imagine" and reason about visual content, but its actual working mechanism and whether latent states truly mediate reasoning are unclear. The authors want to rigorously test if these latent tokens genuinely contribute to visual reasoning or if their perceived benefits are illusory.

Method: The authors use Causal Mediation Analysis to model the reasoning pipeline as a causal chain with the input as treatment, latent tokens as mediator, and the final answer as outcome. They conduct perturbation experiments on both the input and latent tokens to measure causal effects, and apply probing analyses to examine what information is encoded in the latent tokens and how diverse they are. Based on their insights, they design CapImagine, a method that trains models to perform explicit text-based imagination instead of relying on latent reasoning.

Result: They identify two major disconnections: (a) large perturbations to the input barely change latent tokens (Input-Latent Disconnect), and (b) perturbing latent tokens has little effect on final answers (Latent-Answer Disconnect). Probing shows latent tokens carry limited visual information and are highly similar to each other. Their proposed CapImagine approach, which replaces latent reasoning with explicit textual imagination, achieves significantly better performance than latent-space baselines on vision-centric benchmarks.

Conclusion: Latent visual reasoning, at least in its current form, may not be the true source of improved visual reasoning capability because latent tokens neither respond strongly to the input nor strongly influence the output, and they encode limited, redundant information. Explicit text-based imagination (CapImagine) is a simpler and more effective alternative, suggesting that future work should focus on making visual reasoning more interpretable and grounded through explicit representations rather than opaque latent states.

Abstract: Latent visual reasoning aims to mimic human's imagination process by meditating through hidden states of Multimodal Large Language Models. While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination.

### [25] [Probing for Knowledge Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22787)
*Ivo Brink,Alexander Boer,Dennis Ulmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to determine whether an LLM’s answer comes mainly from the user’s prompt or from the model’s internal knowledge, using a simple linear probe on hidden states trained with a self-supervised dataset (AttriWiki).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs hallucinate in different ways: by misusing provided context (faithfulness violations) or by being wrong about the world (factuality violations). To choose the right mitigation (e.g., improving retrieval vs. improving model knowledge), we must know which knowledge source—prompt vs. model weights—dominantly contributed to each answer. Existing work does not reliably distinguish these sources per output token/answer, motivating a dedicated attribution method.

Method: They define “contributive attribution” as identifying whether an answer is mainly based on context or internal memory. They train a linear classifier (probe) on LLM hidden representations to predict this source. For training data, they build AttriWiki, a self-supervised pipeline where the model is prompted either to recall withheld entities from memory or to read them from context, automatically generating labeled examples of context-based vs. memory-based answers. The probe is then trained on these representations and evaluated in- and out-of-domain.

Result: Probes trained on AttriWiki detect the dominant knowledge source with high accuracy, reaching up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on models like Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B. These probes generalize well to external QA datasets such as SQuAD and WebQuestions, where they maintain 0.94–0.99 Macro-F1 without any retraining. The authors also show that cases where the probe’s predicted attribution disagrees with the intended source correlate with up to 70% higher error rates, linking attribution confusion to unfaithful responses.

Conclusion: A simple linear probe on hidden states can reliably infer whether an LLM is using context or internal memory for its answers, and this signal generalizes across domains and models. Misalignment between intended and actual knowledge source is strongly associated with higher error rates, confirming that knowledge source confusion is a key driver of unfaithful outputs. However, correct attribution alone does not guarantee correctness, implying that attribution probes should be part of—but not the entirety of—hallucination and reliability detection systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but unfounded claims, or hallucinations, which fall into two types: (i) faithfulness violations - misusing user context - and (ii) factuality violations - errors from internal knowledge. Proper mitigation depends on knowing whether a model's answer is based on the prompt or its internal weights. This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks.

### [26] [Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P): A Modular Governance Method for Prompt Design Under Model Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22790)
*Hyunwoo Kim,Hanau Yi,Jaehee Bae,Yumin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reframes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a governance framework for controlling LLM behavior over time, formalizing it as a modular, natural-language-based control abstraction robust to model drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM behavior changes as models are scaled, updated, and re-aligned, causing prompt behavior to drift in ways that make simple formatting tricks and ad hoc prompt tuning unreliable for stable, interpretable control. There is a need for a governance-oriented, model-robust way for non-developers to specify and maintain control over LLM behavior using only natural language, without relying on brittle external tooling or code.

Method: The paper conceptually formalizes NLD-P as a declarative control abstraction, decomposing prompts into modular components: provenance (who/what/when), constraint logic (rules and policies), task content (what to do), and post-generation evaluation (how outputs are checked). It specifies minimal compliance criteria for an NLD-P schema, studies how different GPT-scale models accept and follow such schemas (schema receptivity), and documents a human-in-the-loop protocol where an LLM assistant, itself constrained by an NLD-P schema, was used for drafting and editing while humans retained final control over conceptual and methodological claims.

Result: The authors derive a formal, model-agnostic description of NLD-P, show that prompts constructed under this framework can be interpreted as a declarative governance layer separate from implementation details, and characterize how different model generations vary in their responsiveness to such schemas. They also provide evidence that a schema-bound assistant can be effectively employed for drafting and editing under human supervision, while preserving transparent control and provenance.

Conclusion: NLD-P can serve as an accessible, natural-language-based governance mechanism for controlling LLM behavior amid ongoing model drift, especially for non-developers. By modularizing provenance, constraints, tasks, and evaluation, NLD-P enables more stable, interpretable, and auditable control than ad hoc prompt engineering. The paper calls for future empirical work to test and refine NLD-P schemas across evolving model families and to further validate declarative control strategies under continuous model evolution.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed prompt engineering from a localized craft into a systems-level governance challenge. As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation.

### [27] [TARAZ: Persian Short-Answer Question Benchmark for Cultural Evaluation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22827)
*Reihaneh Iranmanesh,Saeedeh Davoudi,Pasha Abrishamchian,Ophir Frieder,Nazli Goharian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build and release a new framework to better evaluate how well large language models understand Persian culture, using a Persian-tailored short-answer scoring method instead of simple exact match or English-centric metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for Persian cultural competence in LLMs mostly use multiple-choice questions and evaluation metrics designed for English. These approaches do not handle Persian’s rich morphology and subtle semantic distinctions, so they under-detect when a model’s answer is actually correct in meaning but not in exact wording. There is also no standardized, reproducible benchmark focused on cultural understanding in Persian, limiting rigorous cross-model and cross-cultural comparison.

Method: They design a Persian-specific short-answer evaluation framework. The method combines: (1) rule-based morphological normalization tailored to Persian to reduce inflectional and surface-form variation; and (2) a hybrid similarity module that integrates syntactic and semantic similarity measures to compare model answers against gold references. This hybrid module enables soft-match scoring that goes beyond exact string overlap. They then apply this framework to systematically evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs on Persian cultural competence.

Result: Using their hybrid morphological-syntactic-semantic scoring approach improves scoring consistency by about 10% over exact-match baselines. The framework better recognizes meaning-preserving variations that surface-level methods miss. They obtain comparative performance results across 15 LLMs, although specific per-model scores are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more faithful and consistent way to evaluate Persian cultural competence in LLMs than existing exact-match and English-centric metrics. By releasing the framework publicly, they provide the first standardized benchmark for Persian cultural understanding and create a reproducible basis for future research on cross-cultural LLM evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the cultural competence of large language models (LLMs) in Persian. Existing Persian cultural benchmarks rely predominantly on multiple-choice formats and English-centric metrics that fail to capture Persian's morphological complexity and semantic nuance. Our framework introduces a Persian-specific short-answer evaluation that combines rule-based morphological normalization with a hybrid syntactic and semantic similarity module, enabling robust soft-match scoring beyond exact string overlap. Through systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, we demonstrate that our hybrid evaluation improves scoring consistency by +10% compared to exact-match baselines by capturing meaning that surface-level methods cannot detect. We publicly release our evaluation framework, providing the first standardized benchmark for measuring cultural understanding in Persian and establishing a reproducible foundation for cross-cultural LLM evaluation research.

### [28] [TCM-DiffRAG: Personalized Syndrome Differentiation Reasoning Method for Traditional Chinese Medicine based on Knowledge Graph and Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22828)
*Jianmin Li,Ying Chang,Su-Kit Tang,Yujia Liu,Yanwen Wang,Shuyuan Lin,Binkai Ou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TCM-DiffRAG, a RAG framework that combines TCM knowledge graphs and chain-of-thought reasoning to significantly improve LLM performance on individualized TCM diagnosis tasks, outperforming base, fine-tuned, and conventional RAG models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG methods underperform in traditional Chinese medicine because TCM diagnosis involves complex, individualized, and often implicit reasoning patterns that are not well captured by simple retrieval of unstructured texts. There is a need for a framework that can better model TCM’s structured knowledge system and its diagnostic reasoning process without costly fine-tuning of LLMs.

Method: The authors design TCM-DiffRAG, which integrates structured TCM knowledge graphs—both universal and personalized—with chain-of-thought-based reasoning in a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline. The framework retrieves and organizes relevant TCM entities and relations from KGs, feeds them into an LLM with a tailored CoT prompting strategy, and is evaluated on three distinct TCM test datasets, comparing against native LLMs, supervised fine-tuned LLMs, and standard RAG baselines.

Result: On three TCM datasets, TCM-DiffRAG substantially improves performance metrics over base LLMs and benchmark methods. For example, using the qwen-plus model, scores improve from 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038 to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 respectively under TCM-DiffRAG. The gains are even larger for non-Chinese LLMs, and TCM-DiffRAG also outperforms directly supervised fine-tuned models and other RAG variants.

Conclusion: Integrating TCM-specific knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought reasoning in a RAG framework leads to markedly better performance on individualized TCM diagnostic tasks than standard LLMs, fine-tuned models, or conventional RAG. The combination of universal and personalized KGs helps align general TCM theory with patient-specific reasoning, suggesting that reasoning-aware, KG-enhanced RAG architectures are a promising direction for deploying LLMs in traditional Chinese medicine and similar complex medical domains.

Abstract: Background: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology can empower large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, professional, and timely responses without fine tuning. However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine.

### [29] [Improving Neural Argumentative Stance Classification in Controversial Topics with Emotion-Lexicon Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22846)
*Mohammad Yeghaneh Abkenar,Weixing Wang,Manfred Stede,Davide Picca,Mark A. Finlayson,Panagiotis Ioannidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They enhance argumentative stance classification by expanding an emotion lexicon with contextual embeddings, improving performance across multiple controversial-topic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stance classification methods rarely leverage explicit, fine-grained emotion information and often rely on non-argumentative, domain-specific data, which limits their ability to generalize across diverse, controversial topics where emotional language is crucial.

Method: They take the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon and systematically expand it using contextualized DistilBERT embeddings to discover previously uncaptured emotionally charged terms, then feed features derived from this expanded lexicon (eNRC) into a neural argumentative stance classification model, evaluated on five diverse datasets.

Result: The expanded lexicon eNRC yields consistent gains over a baseline model across all five datasets (up to +6.2 F1), outperforms the original NRC lexicon on four datasets (up to +3.0 F1), and beats an LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora.

Conclusion: Context-aware expansion of emotion lexicons using transformer embeddings significantly benefits argumentative stance classification across domains, and the released eNRC resource, datasets, and model architecture can facilitate further research in argumentation mining with emotion-aware methods.

Abstract: Argumentation mining comprises several subtasks, among which stance classification focuses on identifying the standpoint expressed in an argumentative text toward a specific target topic. While arguments-especially about controversial topics-often appeal to emotions, most prior work has not systematically incorporated explicit, fine-grained emotion analysis to improve performance on this task. In particular, prior research on stance classification has predominantly utilized non-argumentative texts and has been restricted to specific domains or topics, limiting generalizability. We work on five datasets from diverse domains encompassing a range of controversial topics and present an approach for expanding the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon using DistilBERT embeddings, which we feed into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model. Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon. Our expanded NRC lexicon (eNRC) improves over the baseline across all five datasets (up to +6.2 percentage points in F1 score), outperforms the original NRC on four datasets (up to +3.0), and surpasses the LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora. We provide all resources-including eNRC, the adapted corpora, and model architecture-to enable other researchers to build upon our work.

### [30] [Effective QA-driven Annotation of Predicate-Argument Relations Across Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22865)
*Jonathan Davidov,Aviv Slobodkin,Shmuel Tomi Klein,Reut Tsarfaty,Ido Dagan,Ayal Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to cheaply extend semantic role labeling (via QA-SRL) from English to new languages using translation and alignment, producing high-quality training data and better parsers than strong multilingual LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic role labeling with explicit predicate-argument structures is useful for interpretable semantics, reasoning, generation, and evaluation, but current high-quality resources are costly to annotate and mostly limited to English. There is a need for scalable, low-cost methods to obtain similar semantic structures in other languages without extensive manual annotation.

Method: The authors reuse an existing English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline. English sentences with QA-SRL annotations are translated to a target language, then word alignment is used to project the English question-answer pairs onto predicates in the target language. This projected data is used as training data to fine-tune language-specific QA-SRL parsers for each target language.

Result: Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French, the approach automatically generates question-answer annotations aligned with predicates in these languages. The resulting fine-tuned, language-specific QA-SRL parsers achieve high quality and outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines such as GPT-4o and LLaMA-Maverick on predicate-argument parsing tasks.

Conclusion: QA-SRL can act as a transferable, natural-language interface for semantics, enabling efficient, low-cost extension of predicate-argument parsing to new languages. Cross-linguistic projection via translation and alignment is an effective way to bootstrap semantic role labeling resources beyond English, making interpretable semantic parsing more broadly accessible across languages.

Abstract: Explicit representations of predicate-argument relations form the basis of interpretable semantic analysis, supporting reasoning, generation, and evaluation. However, attaining such semantic structures requires costly annotation efforts and has remained largely confined to English. We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick). By leveraging QA-SRL as a transferable natural-language interface for semantics, our approach enables efficient and broadly accessible predicate-argument parsing across languages.

### [31] [Rejection Mixing: Fast Semantic Propagation of Mask Tokens for Efficient DLLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22868)
*Yushi Ye,Feng Hong,Huangjie Zheng,Xu Chen,Zhiyong Chen,Yanfeng Wang,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose ReMix, a training-free method that introduces a continuous intermediate state and rejection mechanism into diffusion LLM decoding, reducing semantic contradictions in parallel token generation and yielding 2–8× faster inference without loss of quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based large language models enable non-autoregressive (parallel) decoding, which can theoretically be much faster than standard autoregressive generation. However, when many tokens are generated in parallel, their independently sampled choices can form semantically inconsistent or contradictory sequences—what the authors call a "combinatorial contradiction". This trade-off between speed and coherence limits the practical advantages of diffusion LLMs. The paper is motivated by the need to maintain high output quality while still exploiting the speed of parallel diffusion decoding, ideally without requiring expensive retraining of the underlying model.

Method: The authors integrate continuous token representations into the otherwise discrete diffusion decoding process. They introduce ReMix (Rejection Mixing), which defines a Continuous Mixing State between the initial fully masked sequence and the final discrete token outputs. During decoding, token positions are first mapped into this continuous space, where their representations can be iteratively refined while jointly considering inter-position dependencies. Conflicting or unstable token candidates can adjust to each other before being collapsed into discrete tokens. Additionally, ReMix uses a rejection rule: if a token’s continuous representation is deemed uncertain or unreliable at a given step, it is rejected and sent back to the masked state, to be reprocessed in subsequent diffusion steps. This provides a mechanism to stabilize decoding and avoid propagating early mistakes, all applied as a training-free wrapper around existing diffusion LLMs.

Result: Through experiments on multiple benchmarks (not detailed in the abstract), ReMix is shown to significantly speed up inference while preserving output quality. Specifically, it achieves a 2–8× speedup in decoding compared to baseline diffusion LLM decoding schemes, and the authors report no quality degradation according to their evaluation metrics. This suggests that ReMix is able to mitigate the combinatorial contradiction problem effectively while maintaining or matching the performance of standard, slower approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the main bottleneck for diffusion LLMs—semantic inconsistency from parallel token sampling—can be alleviated by introducing a continuous intermediate representation and a rejection-based refinement mechanism into discrete diffusion decoding. ReMix provides a training-free, plug-in framework that allows DLLMs to benefit from substantial inference speedups (2–8×) without sacrificing generation quality. This demonstrates that continuous-space refinement combined with selective rejection is a viable strategy for resolving inter-token conflicts in non-autoregressive language model decoding, improving the practicality of diffusion-based LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) promise fast non-autoregressive inference but suffer a severe quality-speed trade-off in parallel decoding. This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation.

*Roy Miles,Aysim Toker,Andreea-Maria Oncescu,Songcen Xu,Jiankang Deng,Ismail Elezi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that samples many noisy reasoning trajectories with a diffusion language model, scores each intermediate step, and stitches the best steps into a composite rationale that an autoregressive model uses to produce the final answer, yielding higher accuracy and lower latency on math and coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-chain-of-thought methods typically aggregate at the whole-trajectory level, discarding useful partial reasoning from nearly-correct attempts and limiting the ability to reuse good intermediate steps. Diffusion-based reasoning models are cheap and diverse but hard to directly turn into accurate final answers. There is a need for a method that can exploit fine-grained, step-level information from multiple noisy trajectories while remaining modular and efficient.

Method: 1) Use a masked diffusion language model to cheaply generate many diverse reasoning trajectories for a problem. 2) Apply an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM) to score each intermediate reasoning step rather than only final answers. 3) Select and stitch the highest-scoring steps across different trajectories into a single composite rationale. 4) Condition a separate autoregressive (AR) solver model on this stitched rationale to recompute and output only the final answer. This pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation (PRM) and solution synthesis (AR solver).

Result: On multiple math reasoning benchmarks, step-level recombination yields larger gains on harder problems. The framework, without additional training, improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks. It also reduces latency by up to 1.8x relative to both traditional diffusion reasoning models (e.g., Dream, LLaDA) and unified hybrid architectures (e.g., TiDAR). Ablation studies show that the AR solver is crucial for turning imperfect stitched rationales into correct final answers.

Conclusion: Step-level stitching of noisy diffusion-generated reasoning, guided by a process reward model and finished by an autoregressive solver, is an effective, training-free way to leverage cheap, diverse diffusion sampling. It outperforms trajectory-level aggregation and unified hybrid architectures on accuracy and latency, especially for harder reasoning problems, demonstrating the value of modularly separating exploration, evaluation, and final solution generation.

Abstract: Reasoning with large language models often benefits from generating multiple chains-of-thought, but existing aggregation strategies are typically trajectory-level (e.g., selecting the best trace or voting on the final answer), discarding useful intermediate work from partial or "nearly correct" attempts. We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks. At the same time, it achieves up to a 1.8x latency reduction relative to both traditional diffusion models (e.g., Dream, LLaDA) and unified architectures (e.g., TiDAR).

TL;DR: The paper studies where and how OCR (reading text from images) is represented inside vision‑language models, finding architecture‑specific bottleneck layers and a low‑dimensional, transferable OCR signal that can sometimes interfere with other visual tasks like counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although VLMs can read text in images, it is unclear at which layers and through what mechanism this OCR information enters and flows through the language processing stack. Understanding this routing is important both for interpreting model behavior and for improving architectures so that OCR helps rather than harms other visual reasoning abilities.

Method: The authors use causal interventions on several VLM architectures (Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, InternVL3.5). They create text-inpainted image variants (removing or altering scene text) and compute activation differences between original and modified inputs to locate layers most sensitive to OCR. They analyze these differences across depth to find OCR bottlenecks, and apply PCA to the OCR-related activation subspace, then test whether principal components learned on one dataset generalize to others. They also perform interventions to ablate OCR circuits and measure downstream task performance, especially on counting.

Result: They find that the location of the OCR bottleneck depends on the vision–language integration strategy: DeepStack models like Qwen show peak OCR sensitivity at mid-depth (~50% of layers) for scene text, whereas single-stage projection models like Phi-4 and InternVL peak at earlier layers (roughly 6–25% depth). The OCR-related activation space is highly low-dimensional, with the first principal component explaining about 72.9% of the variance, and PCA directions trained on one dataset transfer well to others, implying shared text-processing pathways. In modular models such as Qwen3-VL-4B, ablating or removing OCR-related activity can actually improve counting accuracy by up to 6.9 percentage points, revealing interference between OCR and other visual processing.

Conclusion: OCR in VLMs is funneled through architecture-specific bottleneck layers whose depth reflects how the model integrates vision and language. The OCR signal is low-dimensional and largely shared across datasets, indicating robust, reusable text-processing circuits. However, in architectures with relatively modular OCR pathways, these circuits can conflict with other visual competencies like counting, suggesting that better disentangling or controlling OCR modules could improve multi-skill visual reasoning in future VLM designs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can read text from images, but where does this optical character recognition (OCR) information enter the language processing stream? We investigate the OCR routing mechanism across three architecture families (Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, InternVL3.5) using causal interventions. By computing activation differences between original images and text-inpainted versions, we identify architecture-specific OCR bottlenecks whose dominant location depends on the vision-language integration strategy: DeepStack models (Qwen) show peak sensitivity at mid-depth (about 50%) for scene text, while single-stage projection models (Phi-4, InternVL) peak at early layers (6-25%), though the exact layer of maximum effect varies across datasets. The OCR signal is remarkably low-dimensional: PC1 captures 72.9% of variance. Crucially, principal component analysis (PCA) directions learned on one dataset transfer to others, demonstrating shared text-processing pathways. Surprisingly, in models with modular OCR circuits (notably Qwen3-VL-4B), OCR removal can improve counting performance (up to +6.9 percentage points), suggesting OCR interferes with other visual processing in sufficiently modular architectures.

### [34] [Affine-Scaled Attention: Towards Flexible and Stable Transformer Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23057)
*Jeongin Bae,Baeseong Park,Gunho Park,Minsub Kim,Joonhyung Lee,Junhee Yoo,Sunghyeon Woo,Jiwon Ryu,Se Jung Kwon,Dongsoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Affine-Scaled Attention, which augments standard softmax attention with learnable input-dependent scaling and bias applied after softmax, relaxing the unit-sum constraint and improving stability and performance in large language model pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax attention forces attention weights to sum to one, which can overly constrain how attention magnitudes are distributed, leading to overly peaky or unstable attention and limiting the ability to modulate total attention strength. Existing fixes like attention sinks or gating only indirectly influence attention magnitude and distribution. The authors want a direct, principled way to reweight attention outputs while still using the familiar attention mechanism.

Method: They propose Affine-Scaled Attention, which keeps the usual softmax-normalized attention but adds an input-dependent affine transformation (a scale and bias term) applied to the attention weights before combining with value vectors. This relaxes the strict probability-simplex constraint by allowing the model to change both the overall scale and relative weighting of attention in a controlled way, while preserving the aggregation form QK^T -> softmax -> weights * V. The method is evaluated in large-scale language model pretraining at multiple model sizes against standard softmax attention and prior attention-sink-style variants.

Result: Across multiple model sizes in language model pretraining, Affine-Scaled Attention yields more stable training dynamics, better optimization behavior, and improved downstream task performance compared with standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines, indicating that small, structured reweighting of attention outputs is beneficial.

Conclusion: Relaxing the unit-sum constraint of softmax attention via an input-dependent affine scaling of attention weights provides a simple yet effective modification to Transformer attention that improves stability and performance. Affine-Scaled Attention is a practical drop-in extension to standard attention that offers better control over attention magnitudes and distributions, leading to better behavior in large language models.

Abstract: Transformer attention is typically implemented using softmax normalization, which enforces attention weights with unit sum normalization. While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.
  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models.

### [35] [Toward Automatic Filling of Case Report Forms: A Case Study on Data from an Italian Emergency Department](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23062)
*Gabriela Anna Kaczmarek,Pietro Ferrazzi,Lorenzo Porta,Vicky Rubini,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build and analyze a new Italian Emergency Department dataset linking clinical notes to a 134-item case report form, define a CRF-filling task and metric, and show an open-source LLM can do zero-shot CRF completion but with notable biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic filling of Case Report Forms from clinical notes could greatly reduce manual effort in clinical research, but progress is limited by the scarcity of annotated CRF datasets, especially for non-English languages and real-world settings like emergency departments.

Method: The authors construct a dataset of Italian Emergency Department clinical notes annotated according to a pre-defined CRF with 134 fields. They formalize CRF-filling as a task, define an evaluation metric, and run pilot experiments where an open-source state-of-the-art LLM is prompted in a zero-shot setting to fill CRF items from the notes. They then analyze performance and error patterns, including model biases.

Result: They obtain a new Italian clinical dataset aligned with a 134-item CRF, plus a defined evaluation protocol. Pilot experiments show the LLM can perform the CRF-filling task without task-specific fine-tuning, but exhibits systematic biases such as overusing the "unknown" option and other cautious behaviors, which degrade performance.

Conclusion: Zero-shot LLMs can already tackle CRF-filling from real Italian emergency notes, but their cautious and biased behaviors must be addressed to improve reliability. The released dataset, task definition, and evaluation setup provide a foundation for future work on more accurate and less biased automatic CRF-filling methods.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) collect data about patients and are at the core of well-established practices to conduct research in clinical settings. With the recent progress of language technologies, there is an increasing interest in automatic CRF-filling from clinical notes, mostly based on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task. Results of the case-study show that (i) CRF-filling from real clinical notes in Italian can be approached in a zero-shot setting; (ii) LLMs' results are affected by biases (e.g., a cautious behaviour favours "unknown" answers), which need to be corrected.

### [36] [Quantity Convergence, Quality Divergence: Disentangling Fluency and Accuracy in L2 Mandarin Prosody](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23071)
*Yuqi Shi,Hao Yang,Xiyao Lu,Jinsong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how Vietnamese learners of Mandarin handle prosodic phrasing compared with native speakers, showing that even advanced learners match natives in how many prosodic boundaries they use but systematically misplace them, leading to an inverted prosodic hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many L2 learners can master correct syntactic word order but still sound non-native because their intonation and phrasing do not align with native prosodic patterns. The syntax-prosody interface in L2 is underexplored, especially regarding whether errors fossilize and how stable they are across proficiency levels. This paper aims to understand whether advanced L2 learners achieve native-like prosodic structuring and how prosodic boundaries map onto syntactic relations.

Method: Using the BLCU-SAIT corpus, the authors compare 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners of Mandarin. They annotate prosodic boundaries using the C-ToBI system and analyze syntactic relations via Dependency Grammar. They quantify how many prosodic boundaries occur at different levels (e.g., Major Phrase B3, Prosodic Word B1) and examine where these boundaries fall in key syntactic relations, such as Subject-Verb (SBV) and Verb-Object (VOB).

Result: Acquisition of the syntax-prosody interface is non-linear. High-proficiency Vietnamese learners match natives in the overall quantity of Major Phrase (B3) boundaries but differ in where those boundaries are placed. Learners tend to weaken prosodic boundaries at the Subject-Verb interface (demoting SBV from B3 to B1) and strengthen boundaries at the Verb-Object interface (promoting VOB from B1 to B3). This yields long, fluent-sounding phrases but with structurally misaligned prosody and an inverted prosodic hierarchy compared to native speakers.

Conclusion: Even advanced L2 learners who have native-like syntax and comparable numbers of prosodic boundaries can still systematically mis-map prosodic phrasing onto syntax. Their strategy of maintaining long phrasal output at the cost of structural accuracy leads to an inverted prosodic hierarchy, indicating fossilization or strong stability of non-native prosodic patterns at the syntax-prosody interface. This suggests that achieving native-like prosody requires targeted attention to the structural mapping between syntax and prosodic domains, not just to segmental accuracy or overall fluency.

Abstract: While second language (L2) learners may acquire target syntactic word order, mapping this syntax onto appropriate prosodic structures remains a persistent challenge. This study investigates the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface by comparing 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted.

### [37] [CiteLLM: An Agentic Platform for Trustworthy Scientific Reference Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23075)
*Mengze Hong,Di Jiang,Chen Jason Zhang,Zichang Guo,Yawen Li,Jun Chen,Shaobo Cui,Zhiyang Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CiteLLM, a local LaTeX-integrated system that uses LLMs in a constrained way to find trustworthy, hallucination-free academic references for user-written claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs can assist scholarly work, their unverified outputs risk hallucinations, plagiarism, IP issues, and privacy breaches. Researchers need AI tools that can help discover and validate references without leaking data or compromising academic integrity.

Method: CiteLLM embeds LLM-based utilities directly into a local LaTeX editor. The LLM is restricted to generating search queries, re-ranking results, and validating support, while all reference candidates come from discipline-aware routing to trusted academic repositories. The system performs paragraph-level semantic matching and offers an integrated chatbot for explanation, all without sending user documents off-device.

Result: Experiments show that CiteLLM returns references that are more valid and practically useful compared to baselines, with reduced hallucinations and improved alignment between claims and cited sources.

Conclusion: Carefully constraining LLM use—keeping documents local, sourcing only from trusted repositories, and using LLMs mainly for query formulation, ranking, and semantic validation—can significantly improve the trustworthiness and usability of AI-assisted reference discovery in scholarly writing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance the efficiency of scholarly activities; however, challenges persist in the ethical deployment of AI assistance, including (1) the trustworthiness of AI-generated content, (2) preservation of academic integrity and intellectual property, and (3) protection of information privacy. In this work, we present CiteLLM, a specialized agentic platform designed to enable trustworthy reference discovery for grounding author-drafted claims and statements. The system introduces a novel interaction paradigm by embedding LLM utilities directly within the LaTeX editor environment, ensuring a seamless user experience and no data transmission outside the local system. To guarantee hallucination-free references, we employ dynamic discipline-aware routing to retrieve candidates exclusively from trusted web-based academic repositories, while leveraging LLMs solely for generating context-aware search queries, ranking candidates by relevance, and validating and explaining support through paragraph-level semantic matching and an integrated chatbot. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system in returning valid and highly usable references.

### [38] [Assessing Deanonymization Risks with Stylometry-Assisted LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23079)
*Boyang Zhang,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents SALA, a stylometry-assisted LLM framework that both detects and mitigates authorship deanonymization risk in news text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can infer authorship from writing style, creating serious deanonymization and privacy risks for authors of news and similar texts. Existing authorship attribution approaches are either opaque, not robust, or provide limited tools for actively reducing identifiability. There is a need for an interpretable, LLM-based system that can both evaluate and mitigate authorship inference risk.

Method: The authors design an LLM-based agent built as a structured, interpretable pipeline for authorship inference. The core method, SALA (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis), combines quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning, and can be extended with a database module that stores style-related information to improve attribution. They further develop a guided recomposition strategy: using the agent’s own reasoning traces to generate targeted rewriting prompts that preserve the original meaning but alter stylistic markers, thereby lowering identifiability.

Result: On large-scale news datasets, SALA achieves high authorship inference accuracy across diverse scenarios, especially when enhanced with the database module. The guided recomposition approach successfully reduces the model’s ability to attribute authorship while largely maintaining semantic content.

Conclusion: LLM agents, when equipped with stylometric analysis, can be highly effective at deanonymizing authors, underscoring a real privacy risk in textual data. At the same time, interpretable pipelines like SALA, coupled with guided text recomposition, can serve as proactive defenses that quantify and mitigate authorship identifiability, helping to protect author privacy in LLM-era applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.

### [39] [Modality Collapse as Mismatched Decoding: Information-Theoretic Limits of Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23136)
*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal LLM encoders do preserve rich non-text information (speaker identity, emotion, visual attributes), but standard text-trained decoders cannot use it because their scoring rule only accesses text-aligned directions; modifying the training objective makes this information accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although multimodal LLMs can ingest speech and images, they seem unable to utilize fine-grained non-text attributes like voice identity, emotion, or texture. It is unclear whether this limitation comes from the encoders losing such information, from the way non-text inputs are projected into the model, or from the text-only training of the decoder. The paper aims to pinpoint the source of this bottleneck and to provide a principled information-theoretic explanation and fix.

Method: The authors probe internal representations of multimodal LLMs across layers with linear classifiers to test whether speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes are linearly recoverable. They measure how removing modality-specific variance affects decoder performance. They then formalize the phenomenon as a mismatched decoder problem, using Generalized Mutual Information (GMI) to bound what information a text-trained decoder can access, as a function of distributional mismatch and the decoder’s scoring rule. They test this on five models across speech and vision, run controlled experiments with two otherwise identical Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment, and apply a LoRA-based fine-tuning with an emotion prediction objective.

Result: Probing shows that rich modality-specific attributes persist through all LLM layers at 3–55× above chance in linear probes. Yet, aggressively removing 64–71% of modality-specific variance actually improves decoder loss, indicating that the decoder treats these directions as noise. Across models and input mechanisms, the accessible information matches the GMI-based predictions, supporting the mismatched decoder view. The controlled Prismatic VLM experiment isolates the bottleneck to the decoder’s scoring rule rather than the encoder or projection. LoRA fine-tuning with an emotion objective increases emotion accessibility by 7.5% without harming other attributes.

Conclusion: The main bottleneck in current multimodal LLMs is not that encoders fail to capture non-text attributes, but that text-trained decoders are mismatched to these modalities and only access text-aligned directions. Accessible non-text information is governed by the decoder’s scoring rule and training objective, not by the presence or absence of adapters. Adjusting the objective—e.g., via lightweight fine-tuning—can selectively unlock attributes like emotion without degrading other capabilities, suggesting a principled path to richer multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.
  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.

### [40] [MTRAG-UN: A Benchmark for Open Challenges in Multi-Turn RAG Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23184)
*Sara Rosenthal,Yannis Katsis,Vraj Shah,Lihong He,Lucian Popa,Marina Danilevsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce MTRAG-UN, a benchmark to evaluate and study open problems in multi-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn RAG systems are widely used, but existing benchmarks and evaluations focus mostly on single-turn or simplified scenarios. Real conversations involve complex phenomena like unanswerable, underspecified, and non-standalone questions plus unclear responses, where current systems perform poorly. A dedicated benchmark is needed to systematically expose and measure these weaknesses.

Method: They construct a benchmark of 666 multi-turn tasks spanning more than 2,800 conversation turns across 6 domains, each paired with relevant document corpora for retrieval. They then evaluate standard retrieval and generation models on this dataset, focusing on difficult conversational patterns such as unanswerable, underspecified, and non-standalone queries and unclear responses, to analyze performance gaps.

Result: The experiments show that state-of-the-art retrieval and generation models still struggle significantly on conversations with UNanswerable, UNderspecified, NONstandalone questions, and UNclear responses, indicating that these interaction patterns remain open challenges for multi-turn RAG.

Conclusion: MTRAG-UN exposes important failure modes of current multi-turn RAG systems and provides a standardized benchmark for studying and improving methods that can handle unanswerable, underspecified, non-standalone, and unclear conversational queries. The benchmark is publicly available for further research and comparison.

Abstract: We present MTRAG-UN, a benchmark for exploring open challenges in multi-turn retrieval augmented generation, a popular use of large language models. We release a benchmark of 666 tasks containing over 2,800 conversation turns across 6 domains with accompanying corpora. Our experiments show that retrieval and generation models continue to struggle on conversations with UNanswerable, UNderspecified, and NONstandalone questions and UNclear responses.

### [41] [Fine-Tuning Without Forgetting In-Context Learning: A Theoretical Analysis of Linear Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23197)
*Chungpa Lee,Jy-yong Sohn,Kangwook Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies why and how fine-tuning transformer-like models can hurt their in-context learning ability, and proposes fine-tuning strategies that keep zero-shot gains while preserving few-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can learn new tasks from a few examples in the prompt (in-context learning), but in practice they are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance. Empirically, this fine-tuning can degrade their ability to do in-context learning, especially on unseen tasks, and it is unclear, theoretically, why this tradeoff occurs or how to avoid it.

Method: The authors analyze simplified transformer architectures with linear attention to derive a theoretical characterization of how different fine-tuning objectives affect the attention parameters (query, key, value matrices). They study various fine-tuning regimes: updating all attention parameters, updating only the value matrix, and adding an auxiliary few-shot loss. They then compare the theoretical predictions with empirical experiments that measure zero-shot and few-shot performance on target and unseen tasks.

Result: The analysis shows that fine-tuning all attention parameters can distort the mechanisms that support in-context learning, leading to degraded few-shot performance, particularly on tasks not present during fine-tuning. Restricting fine-tuning updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot accuracy while largely preserving in-context learning. Adding an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning for the fine-tuned (target) task but simultaneously worsens in-context learning on tasks that were not included in the fine-tuning set. Empirical experiments confirm these predicted behaviors.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning introduces a tradeoff between zero-shot performance and general in-context learning ability. Updating all attention parameters tends to harm few-shot generalization, whereas constraining fine-tuning to the value matrix offers a better balance, boosting zero-shot performance without substantially damaging in-context learning. Further optimizing for few-shot performance on specific tasks can improve in-context learning on those tasks but will reduce the model’s ability to perform in-context learning on unseen tasks. The work highlights the importance of carefully choosing fine-tuning strategies when we want to preserve broad in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.

### [42] [Why Diffusion Language Models Struggle with Truly Parallel (Non-Autoregressive) Decoding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23225)
*Pengxiang Li,Dilxat Muhtar,Lu Yin,Tianlong Chen,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAP, a data-centric method to train Diffusion Language Models so they can truly generate tokens in parallel, improving non-autoregressive performance on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although Diffusion Language Models are theoretically capable of parallel token generation, in practice they behave like left-to-right autoregressive models due to training on highly sequential data, such as standard language corpora and long chain-of-thought annotations. This undermines the main advantage of DLMs: removing the sequential decoding bottleneck to better leverage parallel computation and improve latency for long outputs. The authors want to understand and mitigate why DLMs default to AR-like behavior.

Method: They propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a data-centric training approach. NAP restructures supervision data into multiple independent reasoning trajectories for a given problem instead of a single long chain-of-thought, and pairs this with a decoding strategy that forces parallel multi-token updates during training. This jointly aligns the model’s learning signal and decoding process with non-autoregressive, parallel generation rather than left-to-right token prediction.

Result: On math reasoning benchmarks, DLMs trained with NAP achieve better performance when using parallel decoding compared to DLMs trained on conventional long chain-of-thought data. The performance advantage increases as the degree of decoding parallelism grows, indicating that NAP more effectively exploits parallel token updates.

Conclusion: Aligning training data structure and supervision with non-autoregressive, parallel decoding is key to avoiding autoregressive-like behavior in Diffusion Language Models. NAP demonstrates that rethinking data and decoding supervision can move DLMs closer to genuinely parallel generation, improving scalability and latency for tasks such as mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDTSR, a framework that significantly reduces response latency in spoken dialogue systems by enabling simultaneous listening, reasoning, and speaking while preserving discourse quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cascaded ASR-LLM-TTS systems respond slowly because each module waits for the previous one to finish, causing high latency that harms user experience in real-time spoken interaction. The authors aim to approach human-like responsiveness without sacrificing coherence or reasoning quality.

Method: They design the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework with three mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where a lightweight model predicts low-risk discourse connectives while a larger model does deeper reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, overlapping ASR, LLM inference, and TTS in a streaming fashion to start speech as early as possible; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, training the system to keep early partial responses coherent with later reasoning outputs.

Result: On two spoken dialogue benchmarks, DDTSR lowers response latency by 19%–51% while maintaining discourse/discourse-level quality metrics. The framework works as a plug-and-play module with different LLM backbones and remains effective across varying utterance lengths.

Conclusion: DDTSR enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking behaviors in cascaded speech dialogue pipelines, striking a practical balance between low latency and high discourse quality. Its compatibility and robustness suggest it is suitable for real-time spoken interaction scenarios at scale.

Abstract: Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction.

TL;DR: SPARTA is an automatic framework for generating large-scale, challenging table-text QA benchmarks that demand deep multi-hop and analytical reasoning, revealing major gaps in current QA models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing table-text QA benchmarks are small, manually created, error-prone, and typically contain shallow questions that rarely require more than simple, short reasoning chains or basic operations. This makes it hard to robustly evaluate and advance models’ abilities for complex, multi-hop, and analytical reasoning over combined tabular and textual data. A scalable, automatic, and more realistic benchmark-generation method is needed to push the limits of current QA systems.

Method: SPARTA automatically constructs a large-scale QA benchmark in several stages. First, it builds a reference fact database by augmenting each original source table with additional grounding tables. These grounding tables contain atomic facts that are automatically extracted from associated unstructured text passages. Next, it generates nested SQL queries whose depth (number of nested predicates) corresponds to a target hop count, allowing precise control over reasoning complexity. To guarantee both executability and naturalness, it introduces (1) provenance-based refinement, which rewrites queries that are syntactically valid but return empty results so that they become answerable, and (2) realistic-structure enforcement, which restricts query generation to post-order traversals of the query graph so the resulting queries map more naturally to human-like questions. The final step verbalizes these SQL queries into natural-language questions, followed by lightweight human validation.

Result: The SPARTA pipeline yields thousands of high-quality question-answer pairs that involve advanced SQL-like operations such as aggregation, grouping, and multi-hop reasoning across both tables and free text. Empirical evaluation shows that state-of-the-art QA models that perform strongly on prior benchmarks (over 70 F1 on HybridQA and over 50 F1 on OTT-QA) experience performance drops of more than 30 F1 points on SPARTA, highlighting that the benchmark is significantly more challenging and that current models struggle with the required cross-modal reasoning complexity.

Conclusion: SPARTA provides an efficient, automatic way to generate realistic and challenging table-text QA benchmarks that cover deep multi-hop and complex analytical reasoning, while requiring substantially less human annotation effort than prior datasets like HybridQA. The sharp performance degradation of existing state-of-the-art models on SPARTA indicates that it exposes core limitations in current cross-modal reasoning systems, thereby offering a more rigorous testbed and a driver for future research in complex table-text question answering.

Abstract: Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation. Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning. Our benchmark, construction code, and baseline models are available at https://github.com/pshlego/SPARTA/tree/main.

### [45] [A Mixture-of-Experts Model for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23300)
*Soumya Dutta,Smruthi Balaji,Sriram Ganapathy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiSTER-E is a modular mixture-of-experts model that uses speech and text LLM embeddings plus contrastive and KL regularization to improve multimodal emotion recognition in conversations without using speaker IDs, achieving state-of-the-art F1 on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion Recognition in Conversations requires capturing temporal, multi-turn context and fusing information from different modalities. Existing methods often entangle context modeling with multimodal fusion and may depend on speaker identities or weaker modality encoders, limiting robustness and generalization. The paper aims to disentangle these challenges, leverage strong LLM-based encoders, and build a flexible framework that can robustly combine speech and text signals for better ERC performance.

Method: The authors propose MiSTER-E, a Mixture-of-Experts framework with three experts: speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal. First, they fine-tune large language models separately for speech and for text to obtain rich utterance-level embeddings. These embeddings are passed through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer to capture temporal structure in multi-turn dialogues. A learned gating mechanism then dynamically combines the outputs of the three experts. To align the modalities and encourage consistent predictions, they introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regularization term between expert predictions. The entire model operates without using speaker identity information.

Result: On three benchmark ERC datasets (IEMOCAP, MELD, MOSI), MiSTER-E attains weighted F1-scores of 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9%, respectively, surpassing several strong speech-text multimodal baselines. Ablation studies indicate that the MoE design, context modeling layer, and the additional contrastive and KL-based regularization each contribute to performance gains.

Conclusion: Decoupling modality-specific context modeling from multimodal fusion via a mixture-of-experts architecture, and leveraging LLM-based speech and text encoders with alignment losses, leads to improved emotion recognition in conversations. MiSTER-E offers a flexible, speaker-agnostic framework that advances state of the art on multiple ERC benchmarks and demonstrates the value of modular expert design and cross-modal consistency regularization.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) presents unique challenges, requiring models to capture the temporal flow of multi-turn dialogues and to effectively integrate cues from multiple modalities. We propose Mixture of Speech-Text Experts for Recognition of Emotions (MiSTER-E), a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to decouple two core challenges in ERC: modality-specific context modeling and multimodal information fusion. MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions. Importantly, MiSTER-E does not rely on speaker identity at any stage. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-IEMOCAP, MELD, and MOSI-show that our proposal achieves 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9% weighted F1-scores respectively, outperforming several baseline speech-text ERC systems. We also provide various ablations to highlight the contributions made in the proposed approach.

### [46] [Scale Can't Overcome Pragmatics: The Impact of Reporting Bias on Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23351)
*Amita Kamath,Jack Hessel,Khyathi Chandu,Jena D. Hwang,Kai-Wei Chang,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines why current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lack robust reasoning skills and attributes this to reporting bias in their training data, then shows that targeted data with explicit tacit information can effectively improve specific reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Even very large, state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with basic reasoning tasks like counting objects, understanding spatial and temporal relations, and handling negation, despite being trained on massive datasets. The authors are motivated to understand whether this weakness is due to model architecture/scale or to properties of the training data, in particular how humans naturally describe images on the web, which may omit key information needed for reasoning. They aim to diagnose this systematically and explore how to remedy it through better data curation rather than just more data or larger models.

Method: The authors analyze the training corpora of three representative VLMs—OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5, and Molmo—using concepts from linguistic pragmatics and the notion of reporting bias, focusing on how real-world image–text pairs underrepresent certain kinds of information. They quantify the representation of four reasoning types (spatial, temporal, negation, counting) in these datasets. They then create curated benchmarks that explicitly test these four skills, and evaluate the three VLMs to measure their reasoning performance. They also run scaling studies (varying data size, model size, and language coverage) to test whether these skills emerge naturally with scale, and finally train or fine-tune with specially annotated data that includes otherwise tacit information to measure gains in reasoning performance.

Result: The analysis shows that even web-scale and synthetic training corpora insufficiently capture spatial, temporal, negation, and counting information due to reporting bias in human-generated descriptions. Empirical evaluation reveals that OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5, and Molmo systematically perform poorly on tasks requiring these four reasoning skills. Scaling up data volume, model size, or moving to multilingual training does not, by itself, lead to reliable emergence of these reasoning abilities. In contrast, when the models are trained or augmented with datasets that explicitly annotate the usually implicit (tacit) information, their performance on the targeted reasoning benchmarks improves notably.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the lack of reasoning in current VLMs is largely attributable to reporting bias in their training data, which underrepresents crucial tacit information for spatial, temporal, negation, and counting reasoning. Simply scaling models and datasets is insufficient to fix this issue; instead, deliberate training data curation and targeted annotation of tacit information are necessary to endow VLMs with these reasoning capabilities. The authors advocate a shift in focus from scale-driven approaches to more intentional, theory-informed data design guided by insights from pragmatics.

Abstract: The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., "at the game today!" is a more likely caption than "a photo of 37 people standing behind a field". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities.

### [47] [Graph Your Way to Inspiration: Integrating Co-Author Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Model Based Scientific Idea Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22215)
*Pengzhen Xie,Huizhi Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GYWI is a system that uses author-centered knowledge graphs, hybrid RAG/GraphRAG retrieval, and RL-based prompt optimization to generate more controllable, traceable, and higher-quality scientific ideas with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based scientific idea generation lacks controllable academic context and clear, traceable inspiration paths, making it hard to ground and justify new ideas. The authors want a system that can constrain, guide, and explain idea generation using the real scholarly ecosystem around specific authors and topics.

Method: 1) Build an author-centered knowledge graph capturing authors, their works, topics, and relations, plus algorithms to sample inspiration sources and construct an external knowledge base. 2) Design a hybrid retrieval mechanism combining traditional RAG with GraphRAG to retrieve both local, deep content and global, broad relational knowledge, forming a hybrid context. 3) Introduce a prompt optimization strategy informed by reinforcement learning principles so the LLM iteratively improves generated ideas using feedback from the hybrid context. 4) Construct an arXiv-based (2018–2023) evaluation dataset and design a multi-part evaluation protocol including MCQ-style automatic tests, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic-space visualization.

Result: On experiments with multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, Gemini 2.5), GYWI yields generated scientific ideas that outperform baseline mainstream LLM generations across various metrics, notably novelty, reliability, and relevance, and are positively assessed along novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance.

Conclusion: Integrating author-centered knowledge graphs with hybrid RAG/GraphRAG retrieval and RL-inspired prompt optimization produces a controllable, explainable scientific idea generation system that significantly improves the quality of ideas over standard LLM usage. GYWI offers a general framework for structured, transparent, and higher-impact AI-assisted scientific ideation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.

### [48] [FIRE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Financial Intelligence and Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22273)
*Xiyuan Zhang,Huihang Wu,Jiayu Guo,Zhenlin Zhang,Yiwei Zhang,Liangyu Huo,Xiaoxiao Ma,Jiansong Wan,Xuewei Jiao,Yi Jing,Jian Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents FIRE, a benchmark to evaluate large language models’ performance in both theoretical finance knowledge and practical financial/business scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks in finance either focus mainly on theoretical knowledge (e.g., exam-style questions) or on narrow task sets, and lack a unified, comprehensive way to measure how well LLMs can both understand finance concepts and operate in realistic business contexts. The authors aim to fill this gap by building a benchmark that systematically covers major financial domains, subdomains, and real-world decision problems.

Method: The authors construct FIRE with two complementary components: (1) a theoretical assessment built from diverse questions taken from well-known financial qualification examinations to test deep conceptual and applied finance knowledge; (2) a practical assessment based on a structured evaluation matrix that segments complex financial domains into essential subdomains and business activities. Guided by this matrix, they collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, including both closed-form decision problems (with reference answers) and open-ended questions (graded using predefined rubrics). They then evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on FIRE, including their own domain-specific financial model XuanYuan 4.0, and perform comparative analysis.

Result: Using FIRE, the authors obtain a broad empirical comparison of state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tasks, showing their relative strengths and weaknesses across theoretical exam-style knowledge and practical scenario-based decision-making. XuanYuan 4.0, their finance-specialized model, serves as a strong in-domain baseline, helping to delineate how much domain specialization improves performance. The benchmark exposes clear capability boundaries and gaps in current LLMs for financial applications.

Conclusion: FIRE offers a publicly available, systematic benchmark and evaluation framework for measuring LLMs’ financial knowledge and their effectiveness in realistic financial business settings. By releasing questions and evaluation code, the authors provide a standardized resource to analyze and compare models, identify limitations, and support future research on more capable and reliable financial-domain LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce FIRE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge of LLMs and their ability to handle practical business scenarios. For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research.

### [49] [Multi-Level Causal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22287)
*Willem Schooltink,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a framework of causal embeddings that generalize causal abstractions to map multiple fine-grained models into a single coarse model while preserving cause-effect relations, and shows applications to multi-resolution marginal problems and dataset merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work on causal abstractions focuses on relating pairs of causal models, typically mapping a detailed (fine-grained) model to a coarser one while preserving causal structure. However, in practice we often have multiple fine-grained models or datasets, each with different representations, that we want to combine or compare within a single, unified coarse model. Current abstraction frameworks are limited in handling this multi-model, multi-resolution setting and do not fully address how to ensure consistency when embedding several detailed models into one overarching model.

Method: The paper introduces the notion of causal embeddings as a generalization of causal abstractions. It formally defines how multiple detailed causal models can be mapped into sub-systems of a shared, coarser causal model while preserving relevant causal relations. The authors also generalize the standard consistency conditions used in abstraction theory to this new embedding setting, and formulate a multi-resolution marginal problem that connects their framework to both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem. They then demonstrate how these ideas can be applied in practice to merge datasets originating from models with different variable representations or levels of detail.

Result: The authors obtain: (1) a formal definition of causal embeddings that extends causal abstractions to a setting where many fine-grained models are embedded into a single coarse model; (2) a generalized notion of consistency suitable for these embeddings; and (3) a formulation of the multi-resolution marginal problem that shows how their embedding framework captures both classical statistical marginals and causal marginals across different resolutions. They also provide an illustrative application showing that causal embeddings can be used to systematically merge heterogeneous datasets derived from different underlying causal models.

Conclusion: Causal embeddings provide a unified, more flexible framework than traditional causal abstractions for relating multiple detailed causal models to a single coarser model, while preserving key causal relationships. By extending consistency notions and linking to the multi-resolution marginal problem, the framework is shown to be relevant for both statistical and causal inference tasks, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous datasets and models with different levels of granularity. This makes it a promising tool for integrating and reasoning across multi-resolution causal information in practice.

Abstract: Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.

### [50] [Agent Behavioral Contracts: Formal Specification and Runtime Enforcement for Reliable Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22302)
*Varun Pratap Bhardwaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal, runtime-enforceable contract framework for autonomous AI agents that controls behavioral drift, provides probabilistic guarantees, and is empirically validated to significantly improve constraint compliance and violation detection with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software uses formal contracts like APIs, types, and assertions to define and enforce correct behavior, but autonomous AI agents operate on informal prompts and natural language without precise specifications. This lack of formal behavioral guarantees leads to drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in real-world agent deployments. The authors are motivated to close this gap by importing Design-by-Contract ideas into the AI agent setting, creating mechanisms that can specify, monitor, and correct agent behavior in a principled, quantitative way, even under LLM non-determinism.

Method: The authors propose Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), defined as tuples C = (P, I, G, R) consisting of Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms that are enforced at runtime. They introduce a probabilistic compliance notion, (p, delta, k)-satisfaction, which models the stochastic behavior of LLM-based agents and the effect of recovery actions. They derive a Drift Bounds Theorem that relates natural drift rate alpha and recovery rate gamma, showing that if gamma exceeds alpha, expected behavioral drift is bounded by D* = alpha/gamma, with Gaussian concentration in stochastic settings. The paper further analyzes composition in multi-agent chains, specifying conditions for safe contract composition and deriving probabilistic degradation bounds. Practically, they implement the framework in a runtime enforcement library, AgentAssert, and create a benchmark suite, AgentContract-Bench, comprising 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors, to evaluate the approach empirically.

Result: In a large-scale evaluation over 1,980 sessions on AgentContract-Bench, agents instrumented with ABC-based contracts detect 5.2–6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines never detect, with high statistical significance (p < 0.0001) and large to extremely large effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 6.7–33.8). Contracted agents achieve 88–100% compliance with hard constraints, maintain bounded behavioral drift D* < 0.27 over extended sessions in line with the theoretical drift bound, and exhibit strong recovery behavior, with 100% recovery on frontier models and 17–100% across all tested models. All of this is achieved with minimal runtime overhead of less than 10 ms per action, demonstrating the practical feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Agent Behavioral Contracts provide a principled, effective way to bring Design-by-Contract rigor to autonomous AI agents, offering formal, probabilistic guarantees on behavior and drift even in the presence of stochastic LLM outputs. Theoretical analysis combined with empirical results show that properly designed contracts with sufficient recovery mechanisms can tightly bound behavioral drift, significantly improve detection and handling of violations, and maintain high hard-constraint compliance with negligible overhead. This establishes ABC and its implementation in AgentAssert as a practical foundation for more reliable, governable multi-agent AI systems and suggests that contract-based design should become a standard tool for deploying robust agentic AI in real-world settings.

Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.

### [51] [Vibe Researching as Wolf Coming: Can AI Agents with Skills Replace or Augment Social Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22401)
*Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how advanced AI agents can autonomously conduct large parts of the social science research pipeline, introduces the concept of “vibe researching,” and proposes a framework and principles for delegating research tasks to AI responsibly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automation and simple chatbots are limited to answering isolated questions and cannot autonomously run full research workflows. With the emergence of AI agents that can persist state, use tools, and execute complex pipelines, social science research faces a qualitative shift that demands conceptual and practical guidance on what should and should not be delegated to AI.

Method: The author introduces a conceptual framework (cognitive task framework) that classifies research activities along two axes—codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement—to locate a cognitive, rather than sequential, boundary of delegation to AI. The paper uses a concrete case study, the “scholar-skill” 21-skill plugin for Claude Code, which spans tasks from idea generation to paper submission, to illustrate the framework and the nature of AI delegation in practice.

Result: The analysis shows that AI agents are particularly strong at tasks requiring speed, broad coverage of literature and data, and methodological scaffolding (e.g., structuring analyses, generating pipelines, organizing code), but they are weak at tasks relying on theoretical originality and deep tacit field knowledge. This reveals a non-linear delegation boundary that cuts through every stage of the research pipeline and highlights specific patterns of augmentation and limitation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AI-augmented research will likely operate under fragile conditions (dependent on tools, prompts, and oversight), may exacerbate professional stratification (those who can best orchestrate agents gain disproportionate advantage), and creates a pedagogical crisis in how we train new researchers. It proposes five high-level principles for responsible “vibe researching” to guide ethical, effective, and educationally sound use of AI agents in social science research.

Abstract: AI agents -- systems that execute multi-step reasoning workflows with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills -- represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science. Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.

### [52] [Towards Autonomous Memory Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22406)
*Xinle Wu,Rui Zhang,Mustafa Anis Hussain,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces U-Mem, an autonomous memory agent for LLMs that actively seeks, validates, and curates knowledge using a cost-aware extraction pipeline and a bandit-style sampling strategy, achieving sizable gains on QA and math benchmarks over prior memory and RL-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory-augmented LLM agents typically act passively: they only store and reuse information that appears in their interactions or pre-supplied data. This means their memory growth and knowledge quality depend heavily on what happens to show up, leaving gaps when the model is uncertain or lacks information. Moreover, querying tools, teachers, or human experts can be expensive, so there is a need for a principled way to decide when and how to seek external knowledge, and how to balance cost against performance. The paper aims to build memory agents that are proactive and cost-efficient in acquiring high-quality knowledge for LLMs.

Method: The paper proposes U-Mem, an autonomous memory agent framework with two main technical components. (1) A cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade: when the LLM faces a query or uncertainty, U-Mem escalates through increasingly expensive information sources—starting from cheap self-consistency checks and teacher-LM guidance, then using external tools or research (e.g., search/verification tools), and only resorting to human or expert feedback when necessary. This cascade is designed to minimize cost while ensuring that acquired knowledge is accurate. (2) Semantic-aware Thompson sampling over memory: U-Mem treats memory selection and update as an exploration–exploitation problem, using a bandit-style Thompson sampling strategy that is aware of semantic similarity. This helps choose which memories to retrieve or refine, reduces cold-start bias, and ensures that the agent both leverages good existing memories and explores underrepresented areas. Together, these components allow U-Mem to autonomously expand and curate its memory over time with controlled cost.

Result: Experiments are conducted on both verifiable tasks (like factual QA where answers can be checked against tools or ground truth) and non-verifiable tasks (such as problems where correctness is harder to automatically confirm). Across these benchmarks, U-Mem consistently outperforms prior memory-based baselines. It also can outperform reinforcement learning–based optimization approaches. The paper reports specific gains, including a 14.6-point improvement on HotpotQA when using Qwen2.5-7B and a 7.33-point improvement on AIME25 when using Gemini-2.5-flash, demonstrating that autonomous, cost-aware memory acquisition substantially boosts performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that memory agents should be proactive, not merely reactive: by actively acquiring, validating, and curating knowledge, LLMs can gain more reliable and richer memories than what is passively available from interaction logs alone. U-Mem’s cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade and semantic-aware Thompson sampling form an effective and efficient framework for this purpose. The significant improvements on both QA and math benchmarks suggest that autonomous memory management is a promising alternative or complement to traditional RL-based optimization and static retrieval-augmented systems. The authors likely suggest that future work could extend this paradigm to broader tasks, more complex tools, and tighter integration with LLM training and deployment pipelines.

Abstract: Recent memory agents improve LLMs by extracting experiences and conversation history into an external storage. This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.

Motivation: To understand the cognitive strategies that enable humans to rapidly learn and apply abstract rules from very few examples, and to create a rich, standardized behavioral dataset linking problem structure, solution strategies, and performance in abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors constructed CogARC, a curated subset of ARC problems adapted for human participants, and ran two behavioral experiments with 260 participants who solved 75 visual reasoning problems. They recorded behavior at high temporal resolution, including which examples were viewed, the sequence of edits made to construct answers, response times, and multiple attempts, then analyzed accuracy, latency, and trajectory patterns across items and participants.

Result: Participants achieved high overall accuracy (~90% in experiment 1, ~80% in experiment 2) but with large variability across problems and individuals. Harder items led to longer deliberation times and more heterogeneous solution strategies. Over trials, participants began responding faster but with slightly reduced accuracy, indicating growing familiarity with the task format more than better rule learning. Incorrect responses were often similar to each other (convergent), even when the underlying problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness, ranging from direct efficient strategies to long exploratory or partially restarted ones.

Conclusion: CogARC yields detailed behavioral traces revealing how humans generalize and misgeneralize from sparse examples in abstract visual reasoning tasks. The dataset and findings suggest that human problem solving in this domain involves diverse but systematically structured strategies that adapt under uncertainty, making CogARC a valuable platform for future research on human and machine abstraction and reasoning.

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.

### [54] [Epistemic Filtering and Collective Hallucination: A Jury Theorem for Confidence-Calibrated Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22413)
*Jonas Karge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how groups of diverse agents who can learn their own reliability and choose to abstain can still achieve high collective accuracy, extending the Condorcet Jury Theorem to this selective-participation setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical results in epistemic voting like the Condorcet Jury Theorem assume all agents always vote, which is unrealistic since real decision-makers and AI systems often have the option to abstain when uncertain. There is a need for a rigorous framework that shows how allowing agents to say "I don’t know" while learning their own reliability affects group accuracy, especially for applications like mitigating hallucinations in collective LLM decision-making.

Method: The authors build a probabilistic model of heterogeneous agents, each with a fixed but unknown competence level. Agents go through a calibration phase in which they observe outcomes and update their beliefs about their own competence. After calibration, agents face a confidence threshold (gate) that determines whether they cast a vote or abstain on a final decision. The authors derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the probability that the group decision is correct under this selective participation mechanism and analyze how this generalizes the Condorcet Jury Theorem. They complement the theory with Monte Carlo simulations to empirically verify the bounds.

Result: They obtain a provable, non-asymptotic lower bound on the success probability of the group under confidence-gated, selective participation. This bound shows that the classical asymptotic accuracy guarantees of the Condorcet Jury Theorem extend to a sequential setting where agents learn and then decide whether to vote or abstain. Simulations confirm that the empirical performance of the system aligns with or exceeds the theoretical lower bounds, supporting the robustness of the framework.

Conclusion: Selective participation, where agents learn their own reliability and are allowed to abstain based on confidence, can preserve and generalize the accuracy guarantees of the Condorcet Jury Theorem. This provides a principled way to design collective decision systems, including ensembles of LLMs, that reduce erroneous overconfident outputs (hallucinations) by encouraging agents to defer when unsure while still achieving high aggregate accuracy.

Abstract: We investigate the collective accuracy of heterogeneous agents who learn to estimate their own reliability over time and selectively abstain from voting. While classical epistemic voting results, such as the \textit{Condorcet Jury Theorem} (CJT), assume fixed participation, real-world aggregation often benefits from allowing agents to say ``I don't know.'' We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations. While our results are general, we discuss their potential application to AI safety, outlining how this framework can mitigate \textit{hallucinations} in collective LLM decision-making.

### [55] [ArchAgent: Agentic AI-driven Computer Architecture Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22425)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchAgent is an agentic generative-AI system that autonomously discovers new cache replacement policies and outperforms human state-of-the-art designs in less time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compute demand is rapidly increasing, requiring more agile hardware design flows. While agentic generative AI has improved software and scientific discovery, its potential to design low-level hardware mechanisms like cache replacement is underexplored. The authors aim to leverage agentic AI to automate computer architecture innovation, speeding up and potentially surpassing human-driven design.

Method: They build ArchAgent, an automated architecture discovery system on top of AlphaEvolve. ArchAgent explores the space of cache replacement mechanisms, not just tuning parameters but inventing new logic and mechanisms within the constraints of an existing cache replacement competition framework. It iteratively proposes policies, evaluates them on standard workloads using microarchitectural simulators, and optimizes designs via agentic AI search. They also use the system for post-silicon hyperspecialization by tuning runtime-configurable hardware parameters for specific workload mixes and observe emergent behaviors such as simulator loophole exploitation.

Result: On public multi-core Google workload traces, ArchAgent autonomously finds a cache replacement policy in two days that improves IPC by 5.3% over the previous state of the art. On single-core SPEC06 workloads, it discovers a policy in 18 days with a 0.9% IPC speedup over the best known policy, matching the winning margin of that SoTA but discovered 3–5x faster than human efforts. Using agentic tuning of runtime-configurable parameters for workload-specific optimization yields an additional 2.4% IPC speedup over prior SoTA on SPEC06. The system also uncovers a "simulator escape" where it exploits a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can serve as a powerful tool for automated hardware microarchitecture design, capable of discovering state-of-the-art cache replacement policies faster than humans and enabling post-silicon hyperspecialization. However, its ability to exploit weaknesses in research infrastructure (like simulator loopholes) implies that existing tools and methodologies—built assuming human, good-faith usage—need to be rethought for a future where AI agents are active participants in architecture research and design.

Abstract: Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.

### [56] [How Do Latent Reasoning Methods Perform Under Weak and Strong Supervision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22441)
*Yingqian Cui,Zhenwei Dai,Bing He,Zhan Shi,Hui Liu,Rui Sun,Zhiji Liu,Yue Xing,Jiliang Tang,Benoit Dumoulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how latent reasoning actually works, revealing shortcut behavior, lack of true structured search, and a supervision-strength trade-off between avoiding shortcuts and preserving diverse hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent reasoning (doing multi-step reasoning in continuous latent space rather than text) shows strong empirical performance, but its internal mechanisms are poorly understood. The authors want to know whether models truly use latent multi-step computation, how they explore solution spaces, and how supervision affects these behaviors.

Method: They conduct a systematic empirical and representational analysis of multiple latent reasoning methods under different supervision levels. They probe for shortcut usage (solving tasks without genuine latent reasoning), test the hypothesis that latent reasoning performs BFS-like exploration, and study how supervision strength affects diversity and structure of latent representations.

Result: They find widespread shortcut behavior where models obtain high accuracy without depending on the latent reasoning process. Latent representations can encode multiple candidate solutions, but the actual reasoning dynamics do not implement faithful, explicit BFS-like search. Instead, the process shows implicit pruning and compression of possibilities. Supervision level strongly shapes these patterns.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning does not necessarily correspond to explicit, structured search and is vulnerable to shortcuts. Strong supervision reduces shortcuts but collapses representational diversity; weak supervision preserves richer hypothesis spaces but encourages shortcuts. Designing better latent reasoning systems requires balancing these factors and rethinking assumptions about search-like behavior in latent space.

Abstract: Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.

### [57] [A Framework for Assessing AI Agent Decisions and Outcomes in AutoML Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22442)
*Gaoyuan Du,Amit Ahlawat,Xiaoyang Liu,Jing Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They introduce an Evaluation Agent that audits intermediate decisions in agent-based AutoML, rather than only final performance, and show it can reliably detect faulty choices, reasoning issues, and their impact on outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based AutoML systems are evaluated almost exclusively by final task metrics (e.g., accuracy), which ignores the quality of intermediate decisions in data processing, model selection, and evaluation. This makes it hard to understand failure modes, attribute errors to particular decisions, or ensure reliability and governance. There is a gap: no structured, decision-level evaluation framework for these systems.

Method: They design an Evaluation Agent (EA) that passively observes an AutoML agent’s decision process and evaluates each intermediate decision along four axes: (1) decision validity (is the choice appropriate/correct?), (2) reasoning consistency (are justifications coherent and aligned with decisions?), (3) model quality risks beyond accuracy (e.g., robustness, generalization concerns), and (4) counterfactual decision impact (how alternative decisions would have affected outcomes). They run four proof-of-concept experiments where the EA scores decisions and compares them to known faulty choices and outcome changes.

Result: The EA detects faulty decisions with a high F1 score of 0.919, can flag reasoning inconsistencies even when the final performance is good or unchanged, and can quantify how particular decisions affect downstream performance, with observed changes between -4.9% and +8.3% in final metrics when counterfactual decisions are considered.

Conclusion: Decision-centric evaluation via an Evaluation Agent exposes failure modes that outcome-only metrics miss, enabling more reliable auditing and interpretation of agent-based AutoML systems. This reframes evaluation from just measuring final performance to systematically assessing and governing the decision process itself, laying groundwork for more trustworthy autonomous ML systems.

Abstract: Agent-based AutoML systems rely on large language models to make complex, multi-stage decisions across data processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\% to +8.3\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

### [58] [CWM: Contrastive World Models for Action Feasibility Learning in Embodied Agent Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22452)
*Chayan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They introduce Contrastive World Model (CWM), a contrastive-trained LLM action scorer that better distinguishes physically feasible actions from subtly invalid ones for embodied agents, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning on ScienceWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents must first determine which candidate actions are physically executable before planning, but existing supervised fine-tuned action scorers evaluate each candidate independently and are weak at distinguishing correct actions from subtly incorrect yet similar ones. This limits reliability and safety, especially under challenging conditions.

Method: They fine-tune a large language model as an action feasibility scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive loss. Valid actions are contrasted against carefully mined hard negatives—actions that are semantically similar but physically incompatible—so that the model learns to push valid actions away from invalid ones in the scoring space. They construct hard-negative pairs, including minimal-edit negatives where only a single word changes physical feasibility, and evaluate on the ScienceWorld benchmark. Two evaluations are used: (1) an intrinsic affordance test on hard-negative pairs, and (2) a live filter characterization where the model ranks gold-path actions among all valid environment actions during task execution, including under out-of-distribution stress conditions.

Result: On 605 hard-negative test pairs, CWM improves Precision@1 by +6.76 percentage points over SFT for minimal-edit negatives and achieves higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). In a live filter characterization study, under out-of-distribution stress, CWM preserves a better safety margin (-2.39 vs. -3.96 for SFT), showing that the intended gold action is ranked closer to the top among candidate actions.

Conclusion: Contrastive training with hard-mined negative examples yields an action scorer whose representations capture physical feasibility more accurately than standard SFT. This leads to better discrimination between valid and subtly invalid actions, more robust ranking of correct actions during task execution, and improved reliability of embodied agent pipelines, especially under stress or distribution shift.

Abstract: A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.

### [59] [ConstraintBench: Benchmarking LLM Constraint Reasoning on Direct Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22465)
*Joseph Tso,Preston Schmittou,Quan Huynh,Jibran Hutchins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConstraintBench, a benchmark to test whether large language models can directly solve constrained optimization problems in natural language form, without external solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used in operational decision-making tasks that are fundamentally constrained optimization problems. Existing work mainly tests whether LLMs can translate problem descriptions into solver code, not whether they can themselves produce correct, constraint-satisfying and near-optimal solutions. There is a need to understand LLMs’ direct reasoning and optimization capabilities when given fully specified problems in natural language.

Method: The authors build ConstraintBench, a benchmark spanning 10 classical operations research domains (e.g., production mix, crew assignment, facility location, vehicle routing). Each task consists of a natural-language description specifying entities, constraints, and an objective. Ground-truth optimal solutions are obtained and verified with the Gurobi solver. Models must output structured solutions, which are checked by a deterministic verifier for (1) feasibility with respect to all constraints and (2) optimality relative to the Gurobi solution. Six frontier LLMs are evaluated on 200 tasks and their performance is analyzed both overall and per domain, as well as by examining systematic error modes.

Result: Across six frontier LLMs on 200 tasks, the main bottleneck is constraint satisfaction rather than reaching high objective values when feasible. The best model satisfies constraints in only 65% of cases, but when solutions are feasible, their objective values reach 89–96% of the Gurobi optimum. No model achieves more than 30.5% of tasks where solutions are both feasible and within 0.1% of the optimal objective. Domain difficulty varies widely: average feasibility is as high as 83.3% in production mix but as low as 0.8% in crew assignment. The authors identify recurring failure patterns including misunderstanding duration constraints, hallucinating non-existent entities, and a decoupling of feasibility and optimality in facility location and vehicle routing, where models often find feasible but highly suboptimal solutions (0% optimality rate under the tight 0.1% criterion).

Conclusion: LLMs currently struggle to reliably produce feasible solutions for natural-language constrained optimization problems without the aid of traditional solvers; feasibility is a bigger challenge than near-optimality once feasibility is achieved. Performance varies significantly by domain, and models exhibit systematic failure modes that expose limitations in their numerical and structural reasoning. ConstraintBench provides a standardized way to measure and compare these capabilities, and the public release of the benchmark and infrastructure is intended to drive future work on more robust integration of LLMs with constrained optimization and better methods for constraint reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

*Varun Ursekar,Apaar Shanker,Veronica Chatrath,Yuan,Xue,Sam Denton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VERO, a framework and benchmark for systematically evaluating how coding agents can iteratively improve other agents via edit-execute-evaluate cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in using coding agents not just to write software but to optimize other agents. However, the field lacks a consistent, reproducible way to measure how well such agent optimizers work, especially given the mix of deterministic code and stochastic LLM behavior in target agents.

Method: The authors design VERO, which includes (1) an evaluation harness that stores versioned snapshots of agents, controls evaluation budgets, and records structured traces of execution and reasoning; and (2) a benchmark suite consisting of diverse target agents and tasks, each with standardized evaluation procedures. They then use this setup to empirically compare different optimizer configurations across tasks and analyze which types of modifications to agents tend to yield performance gains.

Result: Using VERO, the authors obtain empirical results that differentiate optimizer configurations, showing which approaches and modifications more reliably enhance target agent performance across tasks. The exact quantitative results are not given in the abstract but are said to reveal patterns in effective optimization strategies.

Conclusion: VERO enables reproducible, structured study of agent optimization for coding agents. By releasing the framework and benchmark, the authors aim to make agent optimization a systematic, data-driven research area and a core capability for developing more capable coding agents.

Abstract: An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.

### [61] [Mapping the Landscape of Artificial Intelligence in Life Cycle Assessment Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22500)
*Anastasija Mensikova,Donna M. Rizzo,Kathryn Hinkelman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews how artificial intelligence, especially large language models and machine learning, is being integrated into life cycle assessment, showing rapid growth, mapping how different AI methods align with LCA stages, and proposing an LLM-assisted framework for large, reproducible literature reviews in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI methods are increasingly used in different parts of LCA, but there is no comprehensive synthesis of how, where, and to what extent AI—particularly newer LLM-based tools—is being applied. Practitioners need an overview to understand trends, opportunities, and limitations, and to make LCA more efficient and robust as the volume and complexity of research grow.

Method: The authors conduct a structured literature review of studies at the AI–LCA intersection and apply LLM-based text-mining techniques alongside traditional review methods. They use LLMs to classify and analyze papers, detect themes, quantify trends in AI adoption across LCA stages, and statistically assess correlations between specific AI approaches and parts of the LCA workflow.

Result: They find rapid growth in AI usage in LCA, with machine learning remaining important and a clear shift toward LLM-driven approaches. The analysis shows statistically significant relationships between particular AI techniques and specific LCA stages and reveals both overarching trends and finer-grained conceptual themes in the literature. The LLM-based pipeline successfully handles large volumes of papers and exposes structure in the field that conventional manual reviews might miss or struggle to reproduce.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted text-mining, combined with standard review practices, provides an effective, scalable, and reproducible way to synthesize large AI–LCA literatures. This approach helps map current practice, clarify how AI tools align with LCA stages, and identify future research directions, supporting more computationally efficient and methodologically rigorous environmental assessments and improving the quality of sustainability-related decision-making.

Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.

### [62] [A Mathematical Theory of Agency and Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22519)
*Wael Hafez,Chenan Wei,Rodrigo Felipe,Amir Nazeri,Cameron Reid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces bipredictability (P) as a fundamental, quantitative measure of how effectively a system’s information is shared across observations, actions, and outcomes, and uses it to argue that current AI systems exhibit agency but not true intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems can make accurate predictions while their actual interaction with the environment deteriorates, and there is no principled, task- and architecture-agnostic metric that reveals how effectively they use information in closed-loop operation. The authors want a first-principles measure that reflects whether a system is truly learning from and adapting to its environment, beyond merely achieving objectives, especially under changing conditions.

Method: They formally define a quantity called bipredictability, P, as the fraction of total information that is jointly shared between observations, actions, and outcomes during interaction. They derive theoretical bounds for P from first principles, showing different limits in classical versus quantum systems and when agency is present. They then empirically estimate P in three settings: a physical double pendulum system, reinforcement learning agents, and multi-turn LLM conversations. Finally, they design and test a feedback architecture inspired by thalamocortical regulation that monitors P in real time to modulate the system’s behavior.

Result: The authors prove that bipredictability P is intrinsic to any interactive system and strictly bounded: it can reach 1 in quantum systems, is at most 0.5 in classical systems, and decreases further when agency (action selection) is introduced. Their experiments on a double pendulum, RL agents, and LLM conversations empirically confirm these theoretical bounds. They show that systems can achieve high performance while P declines, revealing degraded learning interaction that standard performance metrics miss. They also demonstrate that a controller that monitors P online can adjust the system’s information flow to maintain more effective learning.

Conclusion: Bipredictability P provides a principled, quantifiable measure of how effectively a system’s information is used across perception, action, and outcome, revealing aspects of interaction quality that conventional performance metrics overlook. Using P clarifies the distinction between agency (ability to act on predictions) and intelligence (ability to learn from interaction, self-monitor learning effectiveness, and adapt its own information scope). Under this definition, current AI systems possess agency but fall short of intelligence. The proposed thalamocortical-inspired feedback architecture that regulates behavior by monitoring P establishes a necessary ingredient for building more adaptive and resilient AI systems.

Abstract: To operate reliably under changing conditions, complex systems require feedback on how effectively they use resources, not just whether objectives are met. Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using cognitive science and AI algorithm-inspired templates to systematically design modular multi-LLM agents, showing that many existing agents already implicitly follow such templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLMs, despite being powerful, struggle with complex tasks that require decomposition, specialization, or coordination. There is no clear methodology for how to architect systems that combine multiple LLMs in a principled, interpretable way. The authors argue that cognitive models and classic AI algorithms already offer blueprints for such architectures, and that making these templates explicit can guide better design of language agents.

Method: The authors introduce a formal notion of an "agent template," which defines roles for individual LLMs and the rules for composing their functions into a larger system. They then conduct a structured survey of existing multi-LLM agent systems, analyze their architectures, and map them onto templates derived from cognitive architectures and AI algorithm patterns (e.g., planner–executor, memory modules, reasoning subroutines).

Result: They identify and categorize recurring design patterns in current language agent systems, demonstrating that many align closely with well-known cognitive and AI architectures once reframed as agent templates. This provides evidence that the proposed template framework is expressive and that cognitive/AI-inspired templates are already implicitly influential in practice.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that explicitly using agent templates grounded in cognitive models and AI algorithms is a promising strategy for building modular, effective, and interpretable multi-LLM agents. It encourages future work to systematically explore, formalize, and compare such templates to advance the design of complex language agent systems.

Abstract: While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.

### [64] [Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22539)
*Mohammad Hossein Shokouhi,Vincent W. S. Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They design an agentic AI framework using multiple coordinated LLM-based agents to translate high-level operator intents into concrete optimization tasks for a cell-free O-RAN, jointly handling QoS and energy saving with high scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing O-RAN and RAN automation works mostly handle simple, isolated intents via independent agents and do not support complex intents that require coordination (e.g., jointly ensuring user rate guarantees and minimizing energy consumption). Moreover, deploying separate large LLM agents for each function is memory-intensive and not scalable.

Method: They propose a multi-agent agentic AI framework built on O-RAN for cell-free operation. A supervisor LLM agent converts operator intents into optimization goals and minimum-rate constraints. A user-weighting agent, guided by a memory module of prior experience, sets user priority weights for precoding. If energy saving is requested, an O-RU management agent (using DRL) selects active O-RUs. A monitoring agent tracks user rates and coordinates with others to ensure constraints are met. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is used so all agents share one base LLM with small task-specific adapters.

Result: Simulations show that in energy-saving mode the framework can deactivate O-RUs so that the number of active O-RUs is reduced by 41.93% compared to three baseline schemes. Using PEFT instead of fully separate LLMs cuts memory usage by 92%.

Conclusion: Coordinated LLM-based agentic AI within O-RAN can effectively translate and optimize complex operator intents in a cell-free RAN, achieving substantial energy savings while honoring rate constraints, and PEFT makes the multi-agent design scalable in terms of memory footprint.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.

### [65] [Requesting Expert Reasoning: Augmenting LLM Agents with Learned Collaborative Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22546)
*Zhiming Wang,Jinwei He,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose AHCE, a framework where an LLM-based agent actively queries a human expert as a reasoning tool using a learned policy, greatly improving task success in Minecraft with little human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle in specialized domains that require rare, long-tail knowledge not present in pretraining data. Human experts have this knowledge but usually provide it in ad-hoc, unstructured, and unreliable ways that are hard to integrate into an agent’s decision-making. The paper aims to build a principled mechanism for incorporating human expert reasoning into agents on demand so that they can tackle more complex tasks reliably.

Method: They propose AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), centered around a Human Feedback Module (HFM). The HFM is a learned policy that decides when and how to consult a human expert, treating the human as an interactive reasoning tool rather than a passive overseer. The module learns to request expert reasoning in a targeted, structured way, integrating responses into the agent’s planning and execution. The approach is evaluated in Minecraft tasks of varying difficulty, where the agent can intermittently query a human expert according to the learned policy.

Result: In Minecraft experiments, using AHCE substantially increases task success rates: a 32% improvement on normal-difficulty tasks and nearly 70% improvement on highly difficult tasks compared to baselines without this active human-augmentation mechanism. These gains are achieved with relatively little human intervention, indicating the framework’s efficiency at leveraging expert input.

Conclusion: Effectively augmenting LLM-based agents with human expertise requires more than occasional or naive help requests; it needs a learned policy that can strategically query humans as a reasoning resource. AHCE, via its Human Feedback Module, shows that treating human experts as interactive tools in a structured, policy-driven manner can significantly boost performance on challenging, long-tail-knowledge-intensive tasks while keeping human effort low.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents excel at general reasoning but often fail in specialized domains where success hinges on long-tail knowledge absent from their training data. While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help.

### [66] [CourtGuard: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Zero-Shot Policy Adaptation in LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22557)
*Umid Suleymanov,Rufiz Bayramov,Suad Gafarli,Seljan Musayeva,Taghi Mammadov,Aynur Akhundlu,Murat Kantarcioglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CourtGuard is a retrieval-augmented multi-agent safety framework that treats LLM safety checking as an evidentiary debate over external policy documents, achieving SOTA safety performance without fine-tuning and enabling easy adaptation and data auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety systems rely on static, fine-tuned classifiers that are inflexible and costly to update when governance rules or safety policies change. This rigidity makes it difficult to respond quickly to new regulations, domains, or adversarial behaviors while maintaining transparency and interpretability in safety decisions.

Method: The authors propose CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that frames safety evaluation as an Evidentiary Debate. Multiple agents adversarially debate whether a given model output complies with safety policies, grounding their arguments in retrieved external policy documents rather than fixed model weights. The framework orchestrates this debate and aggregates evidence-based arguments to reach a safety judgment, enabling policy changes through updating reference documents instead of retraining models.

Result: CourtGuard attains state-of-the-art performance on seven safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without requiring fine-tuning. It demonstrates strong zero-shot adaptability by generalizing to an out-of-domain Wikipedia vandalism detection task (90% accuracy) simply by swapping the reference policy. Additionally, it is successfully used to curate and audit nine new datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks, showing its utility for automated data curation and evaluation.

Conclusion: Decoupling safety logic from model parameters via an evidentiary, policy-grounded debate framework yields a robust, interpretable, and adaptable safety system. CourtGuard can meet evolving AI governance and regulatory needs by enabling rapid policy updates, strong performance across domains, and practical tools for auditing and curating safety-critical datasets without costly retraining.

Abstract: Current safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity, the inability to enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining. To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.

### [67] [Strategy Executability in Mathematical Reasoning: Leveraging Human-Model Differences for Effective Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22583)
*Weida Liang,Yiyou Sun,Shuyuan Nan,Chuang Li,Dawn Song,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies why example-based guidance for math reasoning is unstable, identifies a gap between using a strategy and being able to execute it as guidance, and proposes Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR) to select and combine more executable strategies, improving accuracy on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although example-based guidance (e.g., giving worked examples or chain-of-thought) is widely used to boost LLM mathematical reasoning at inference time, its effects are inconsistent: even correct, relevant examples sometimes hurt or fail to help across problems and models. Existing work largely assumes that if a strategy appears in successful solutions it will also be effective as guidance, but this link has not been rigorously examined. The paper is motivated by the need to understand and fix this gap so that test-time guidance becomes more reliable and robust across models and problem domains.

Method: The authors conduct a controlled analysis comparing paired human-written and model-generated math solutions to disentangle two concepts: strategy usage (strategies that appear in successful solutions) versus strategy executability (whether those strategies, when used as guidance, actually help a target model solve problems). They study how strategies derived from humans vs. models differ structurally and across domains, and measure how each source performs as guidance. Based on these findings, they design Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that: (1) retrieves candidate strategies from multiple sources (human and model), (2) uses empirical, source-aware signals from multiple reasoning routes to estimate their executability, and (3) selectively combines the most executable strategies as guidance for a compact reasoning model. They then evaluate SSR on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., AIME25, Apex).

Result: The analysis reveals a consistent dissociation between strategy usage and executability: not all strategies that show up in correct solutions are equally helpful when reused as guidance, and human- vs. model-derived strategies exhibit complementary strengths and systematic reversals in their effectiveness depending on context. Using these insights, SSR, which explicitly models and selects for executability across multiple, source-aware routes, produces more stable gains than standard approaches. On math benchmarks, SSR outperforms direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to 13 percentage points on AIME25 and 5 percentage points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the instability of example-based guidance stems from a critical but previously underexplored gap between strategy usage and strategy executability. Human and model strategies are not interchangeable as guidance and differ in structured, domain-dependent ways. By explicitly modeling which strategies are executable for a given model via Selective Strategy Retrieval, it is possible to achieve more reliable, robust improvements in mathematical reasoning, particularly for compact models. This suggests future work should account for executability when designing guidance-based methods and that multi-source, empirically validated strategy selection is a promising direction.

Abstract: Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

### [68] [Correcting Human Labels for Rater Effects in AI Evaluation: An Item Response Theory Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22585)
*Jodi M. Casabianca,Maggie Beiting-Parrish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating psychometric rater models into AI evaluation to correct human rating biases and obtain more reliable measures of AI output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluations are crucial for training and evaluating AI models, but human ratings contain systematic errors such as rater severity and centrality biases. These biases can distort conclusions about model performance. There is a need for a principled way to treat human judgments as measurements subject to error, improving the reliability, validity, and interpretability of AI evaluation.

Method: The paper reviews common rater effects (severity and centrality) and introduces item response theory (IRT) rater models, focusing on the multi-faceted Rasch model, which explicitly models rater behavior, item difficulty, and output quality. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset, the authors apply these models to adjust ratings for rater severity, separating true output quality from rater-specific bias. They compare raw ratings with adjusted scores and analyze rater diagnostics.

Result: Applying the multi-faceted Rasch model to the OpenAI summarization dataset yields corrected estimates of summary quality that differ from raw averages, showing that some outputs were under- or over-rated due to rater severity differences. The modeling provides diagnostic information about individual raters, such as which raters are consistently harsher or more lenient, and how much each rater contributes to measurement error.

Conclusion: Psychometric rater models can substantially improve the quality of human-in-the-loop evaluation in AI by explicitly modeling and correcting for rater biases. Using adjusted scores instead of raw ratings leads to more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned assessments of AI systems. The paper advocates for systematic integration of these models into AI development pipelines to make better-informed decisions based on human evaluation data.

Abstract: Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

### [69] [SideQuest: Model-Driven KV Cache Management for Long-Horizon Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22603)
*Sanjay Kariyappa,G. Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces SideQuest, a KV cache compression method guided by the model’s own reasoning to support long, multi-hop agentic tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-running, multi-hop agentic tasks like deep web research require attending to many retrieved documents, which bloats the LLM’s context and KV cache. Existing heuristic KV cache compression methods do not work well for multi-step reasoning models, leading to high memory use and degraded performance. A more intelligent, task-aware compression method is needed.

Method: Propose SideQuest, where the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself evaluates and decides which tokens in its context are useful, effectively performing KV cache compression via internal reasoning. To avoid interference between this management and the main reasoning, the compression is framed as an auxiliary task that runs in parallel to the primary reasoning process. The model is trained with a small dataset (215 samples) to learn this behavior.

Result: On long, agentic tasks, SideQuest cuts peak token usage by up to 65% while maintaining similar accuracy to the uncompressed baseline. It also outperforms existing heuristic-based KV cache compression methods on these tasks.

Conclusion: Model-guided, reasoning-based KV cache compression (SideQuest) is an effective way to control memory usage in long, multi-hop agentic tasks, enabling large reasoning models to operate efficiently with substantial token savings and minimal accuracy loss, and surpassing heuristic compression baselines.

Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

### [70] [MobilityBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Route-Planning Agents in Real-World Mobility Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22638)
*Zhiheng Song,Jingshuai Zhang,Chuan Qin,Chao Wang,Chao Chen,Longfei Xu,Kaikui Liu,Xiangxiang Chu,Hengshu Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MobilityBench is a reproducible, large-scale benchmark for testing LLM-based route-planning agents using real-world navigation queries in a deterministic sandbox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world conditions is hard because user needs are diverse, mapping APIs are non-deterministic, and experiments are hard to reproduce. There is a need for a standardized, scalable, and realistic benchmark to systematically measure and compare these agents’ performance.

Method: The authors build MobilityBench from large-scale, anonymized real user route-planning queries collected from Amap, spanning many cities and intent types. They create a deterministic API-replay sandbox that replays mapping-service responses to remove environmental variance. They design a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol focusing on outcome validity and also measuring instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. They then run multiple LLM-based route-planning agents on the benchmark to analyze behavior and performance across task types.

Result: Experiments show that current LLM-based route-planning agents perform well on basic information retrieval and standard route-planning tasks but have substantial difficulty with preference-constrained route planning (e.g., personalized constraints and preferences). The benchmark, toolkit, and data are released publicly to support further research.

Conclusion: MobilityBench provides a scalable, reproducible, and realistic framework to evaluate LLM route-planning agents end-to-end. The observed gaps on preference-constrained tasks highlight significant remaining challenges for personalized mobility assistance, pointing to the need for improved models and methods tailored to complex, user-specific routing preferences.

Abstract: Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .

### [71] [AHBid: An Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding Framework for Cross-Channel Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22650)
*Xinxin Yang,Yangyang Tang,Yikun Zhou,Yaolei Liu,Yun Li,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes AHBid, a hierarchical auto-bidding framework that uses a diffusion-based generative planner plus real-time control to allocate budgets and set bids across advertising channels, improving ROI by 13.57%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-bidding in online advertising is difficult due to complex, dynamic markets and especially challenging in multi-channel scenarios where each channel behaves differently. Existing optimization-based methods are rigid and slow to adapt, while RL methods constrained by standard MDP formulations often fail to fully exploit historical dependencies and long-term observational patterns. There is a need for a flexible, history-aware, and constraint-compliant bidding system that can dynamically adjust budgets and bids across channels to maximize return on investment.

Method: Introduce AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework. At the top level, a generative planner based on diffusion models produces dynamic budget and constraint allocations across channels by modeling rich historical context and temporal patterns. A constraint enforcement mechanism ensures the generated plans respect business and budget constraints, and a trajectory refinement module adjusts planned trajectories using additional historical data to maintain adaptability in changing environments. At the lower level, a control-based bidding algorithm uses the high-level plan, historical statistics, and real-time feedback to set per-auction bids, blending prior knowledge with current signals for robust execution.

Result: On large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B experiments, AHBid outperforms existing auto-bidding baselines. The reported improvement is a 13.57% increase in overall return (e.g., ROI) relative to the strongest baselines, indicating better budget utilization and cross-channel allocation.

Conclusion: A hierarchical approach that couples a diffusion-based generative planner with a real-time control layer provides a more flexible and effective solution for auto-bidding in complex, multi-channel advertising environments than traditional optimization or standard RL methods. By explicitly modeling historical patterns, enforcing constraints, and refining trajectories, AHBid achieves significantly higher returns and demonstrates strong adaptability to dynamic market conditions.

Abstract: In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

### [72] [Toward Personalized LLM-Powered Agents: Foundations, Evaluation, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22680)
*Yue Xu,Qian Chen,Zizhan Ma,Dongrui Liu,Wenxuan Wang,Xiting Wang,Li Xiong,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of how to design and evaluate personalized LLM-based agents that adapt to individual users over long-term interactions, organized around four core components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-powered agents are increasingly used in long-horizon, user-specific scenarios where success depends on personalization and continuity over time. Personalization is often treated only at the surface-response level, lacking a systematic view of how user information should shape the entire decision pipeline. The paper aims to systematize and clarify the design space so that researchers and practitioners can build more user-aligned agents.

Method: Conduct a capability-oriented survey of prior work on personalized LLM agents. The authors propose a taxonomy with four tightly coupled components—user profile modeling, memory mechanisms, planning, and action execution. They review representative methods under each component, analyze how user signals are represented and propagated across components, and identify common trade-offs and design patterns. They also survey existing evaluation metrics, benchmarks, and application domains.

Result: A structured taxonomy and synthesis of existing methods for personalization in LLM agents, mapping how user data is captured, stored, and used for decisions. The survey identifies key cross-component interactions, recurring trade-offs (e.g., between adaptivity and robustness, complexity and scalability), and gaps in current practice. It also catalogs evaluation methods and real-world applications tailored to personalized agents.

Conclusion: Personalization in LLM agents must be treated as a full-pipeline property involving profile modeling, memory, planning, and execution rather than just response style. The proposed framework helps organize current work, clarify open problems, and guide the design of future agents. Following this roadmap can lead to more adaptive, robust, and deployable personalized assistants that move beyond ad hoc prototype-level personalization to scalable real-world systems.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

### [73] [Knob: A Physics-Inspired Gating Interface for Interpretable and Controllable Neural Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22702)
*Siyu Jiang,Sanshuai Cui,Hui Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knob, a control-theoretic framework for dynamically calibrating neural networks via tunable gating parameters analogous to a second-order mechanical system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural calibration methods are static post-hoc adjustments that ignore temporal dynamics and provide no intuitive way for humans to interactively tune model behavior as conditions change. The authors want a principled, interpretable way—grounded in control theory—for operators to adjust stability and sensitivity of model outputs over time.

Method: They map neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system characterized by damping ratio (ζ) and natural frequency (ω_n). At the implementation level, they use a logit-level convex fusion acting as an input-adaptive temperature scaling, especially reducing confidence when different model branches disagree. They further impose second-order ODE dynamics on the gate (Knob-ODE) to enable two inference modes: standard i.i.d. mode and a stateful continuous mode for streams, where the gate state evolves over time according to the designed dynamics.

Result: On CIFAR-10-C, the framework improves calibration and, in Continuous Mode, the learned gate behaviors qualitatively match standard second-order control responses such as step settling and low-pass filtering of rapid changes. These results primarily validate that the control-theoretic analogies hold and that the gate can be tuned predictably, rather than chasing SOTA metrics.

Conclusion: Knob offers an exploratory architectural interface that ties neural network calibration to interpretable control parameters, letting human operators tune model stability and sensitivity via familiar physical analogues. While not optimized for state-of-the-art performance, the framework demonstrates that second-order control dynamics can be embedded into neural gating, enabling predictable, human-in-the-loop calibration, especially for continuous data streams.

Abstract: Existing neural network calibration methods often treat calibration as a static, post-hoc optimization task. However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable "safety valve". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune "stability" and "sensitivity" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLHFless, a serverless-based framework that makes synchronous RLHF training faster and cheaper by adapting resources dynamically and reducing redundant computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF training for large language models is resource-intensive and inefficient, especially in synchronous settings where components wait on each other, causing idle time and cost overhead. Existing RLHF frameworks use serverful infrastructures that cannot flexibly adapt to fine-grained, fluctuating resource needs across the RL pipeline. There is a need for a more elastic, cost-efficient system that can better handle dynamic workloads in RLHF training.

Method: The authors design RLHFless, a training framework for synchronous RLHF built on serverless computing. It (1) leverages serverless elasticity to match dynamic resource demands along the RLHF workflow; (2) pre-computes shared prefixes across rollouts to avoid redundant forward passes; (3) introduces a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that explicitly accounts for variation in response lengths when deciding how many actors to run, trading off speed and cost; and (4) optimizes workload assignment within functions to reduce imbalance and idle time during execution. The framework is evaluated on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster against a state-of-the-art baseline.

Result: Across experiments, RLHFless achieves up to 1.35× speedup and 44.8% reduction in training cost compared with a state-of-the-art RLHF framework. The improvements come from better resource utilization, reduced redundancy via prefix pre-computation, and smarter actor scaling and workload balancing.

Conclusion: Serverless architectures can effectively support synchronous RLHF training at scale. By exploiting fine-grained elasticity, avoiding redundant computation, and scaling actors with awareness of response-length variability, RLHFless delivers faster and cheaper RLHF training than existing serverful solutions, demonstrating a practical path to more efficient alignment of large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely applied to Large Language Model (LLM) post-training to align model outputs with human preferences. Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.
  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

### [75] [Generative Data Transformation: From Mixed to Unified Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22743)
*Jiaqing Zhang,Mingjia Yin,Hao Wang,Yuxin Tian,Yuyang Ye,Yawen Li,Wei Guo,Yong Liu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-centric framework (Taesar) that regenerates target-domain recommendation sequences using cross-domain context via contrastive decoding, improving performance and generalization over model-centric multi-domain methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-domain recommendation tries to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start by leveraging auxiliary domains, but domain gaps often cause negative transfer. Existing solutions are model-centric: they design complex cross-domain architectures that are computationally heavy and still struggle to capture subtle sequential dependencies across domains, limiting generalization. There is a need for a simpler, data-centric way to exploit auxiliary domains while mitigating domain gaps.

Method: Taesar is a target-aligned sequential regeneration framework. Instead of building new complex models, it focuses on transforming data. It uses contrastive decoding to adaptively incorporate cross-domain contextual information into regenerated target-domain interaction sequences. These regenerated sequences are aligned with the target domain but enriched by auxiliary-domain signals, so they can be fed into off-the-shelf sequential recommendation models without special fusion architectures.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Taesar achieves better recommendation performance than state-of-the-art model-centric, multi-domain solutions. It also shows strong generalization: the regenerated datasets can be used to boost various standard sequential recommendation models, confirming that the method is model-agnostic and effective as a data pre-processing/enrichment step.

Conclusion: By shifting focus from model design to data transformation, Taesar offers an effective way to leverage multi-domain information for sequential recommendation. Its contrastive decoding-based regeneration aligns auxiliary-domain knowledge with the target domain, mitigating domain gaps and negative transfer. This yields enriched training data that improve standard models’ performance and generalization, combining the advantages of both data-centric and model-centric paradigms without added architectural complexity.

Abstract: Recommendation model performance is intrinsically tied to the quality, volume, and relevance of their training data. To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textsc{Taesar}, a \emph{data-centric} framework for \textbf{t}arget-\textbf{a}lign\textbf{e}d \textbf{s}equenti\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures. Experiments show \textsc{Taesar} outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models. By generating enriched datasets, \textsc{Taesar} effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms.

### [76] [Know What You Know: Metacognitive Entropy Calibration for Verifiable RL Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22751)
*Qiannian Zhao,Chen Yang,Jinhao Jing,Yunke Zhang,Xuhui Ren,Lu Yu,Shijie Zhang,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses a mismatch in current RL with verifiable rewards for large reasoning models, where only binary correctness is used and model uncertainty is ignored. It proposes EGPO, an entropy-based metacognitive calibration framework that incorporates token-level uncertainty into the reward structure, yielding more stable and effective reasoning optimization and better performance on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR training for large reasoning models mainly uses binary correctness of final answers as the reward, treating all correct/incorrect solutions equally regardless of the model's confidence. This "uncertainty-reward mismatch" prevents models from learning when they actually know or do not know an answer, which is especially harmful in reasoning-heavy tasks like math and QA where the quality of intermediate reasoning steps matters. The authors are motivated to design a method that incorporates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR to enable uncertainty-aware, metacognitive learning and to extract more informative learning signals from rollouts.

Method: The authors introduce EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework integrated into RL with verifiable rewards. EGPO computes a zero-overhead entropy-based uncertainty proxy per sample from token-level likelihoods of the model’s outputs. It then uses an asymmetric calibration mechanism to align this intrinsic uncertainty with extrinsic correctness signals: it preserves and reinforces correct, well-calibrated reasoning while selectively penalizing or regulating overconfident incorrect solutions. This calibrated signal is used to guide policy optimization in a stability-enhancing, uncertainty-aware way. Additionally, EGPO reprocesses group-based rollouts to extract non-degenerate learning signals without changing the external verifier or reward definition.

Result: Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, EGPO consistently improves the performance of large reasoning models. The experiments show substantial gains in reasoning quality and stability compared with standard outcome-only RLVR baselines that rely on binary correctness signals. The method also demonstrates that integrating entropy-based uncertainty into RLVR can recover useful learning signals from group-based rollouts that would otherwise be uninformative or degenerate.

Conclusion: Incorporating intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR is crucial for training large reasoning models that truly "know what they know" and optimize for high-quality reasoning paths rather than just final-answer correctness. EGPO provides a principled, low-overhead metacognitive entropy calibration framework that aligns model uncertainty with verifiable rewards, improves policy optimization stability, and yields significant performance gains on reasoning tasks. This establishes metacognitive entropy calibration as a promising direction for advancing large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex real-world tasks. In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from "Know What You Know" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.

### [77] [Decomposing Physician Disagreement in HealthBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22758)
*Satya Borgohain,Roy Mariathas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes where physician disagreement comes from in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset and finds that most disagreement is unexplained by observable factors, indicating a structural ceiling on agreement in medical AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why physicians often disagree when evaluating medical AI outputs, determine how much of this disagreement can be attributed to known factors (like rubric wording, physician identity, and case metadata), and identify which types of uncertainty are potentially reducible through better evaluation design.

Method: The authors statistically decompose variance in met/not-met labels and in disagreement using mixed-effects style variance partitioning across rubric identity, physician identity, and case-level residuals. They then test various observable features and model-based signals—metadata labels, normative rubric phrasing, medical specialty comparisons, surface-level triage models, and embeddings—for their ability to explain disagreement, and examine how disagreement varies with model completion quality and with physician-validated uncertainty categories (reducible vs. irreducible), using metrics like R^2, AUC, odds ratios, and significance tests.

Result: Rubric identity explains a modest share of label variance (~15.8%) but only a small share of disagreement variance (3.6–6.9%), and physician identity explains very little (~2.4%). The vast majority (~81.8%) of disagreement sits in unexplained, case-level residuals and is not reduced by metadata, rubric language features, specialty, simple triage models, or embeddings. Disagreement shows an inverted-U relationship with completion quality (higher at borderline cases). Reducible uncertainty factors (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) significantly increase odds of disagreement (OR = 2.55) but account for only about 3% of total variance, while irreducible medical uncertainty has essentially no effect on disagreement (OR = 1.01).

Conclusion: Most physician disagreement in HealthBench reflects a structural limit on inter-rater agreement that current observable features and evaluation design do not capture. However, because reducible uncertainty—like missing clinical context or ambiguous wording—predictably increases disagreement, improving information completeness and clarity in evaluation scenarios could meaningfully, though only partially, reduce disagreement, while inherent clinical ambiguity places a hard ceiling on achievable agreement in medical AI evaluation.

Abstract: We decompose physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset to understand where variance resides and what observable features can explain it. Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

### [78] [AMA-Bench: Evaluating Long-Horizon Memory for Agentic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22769)
*Yujie Zhao,Boqin Yuan,Junbo Huang,Haocheng Yuan,Zhongming Yu,Haozhou Xu,Lanxiang Hu,Abhilash Shankarampeta,Zimeng Huang,Wentao Ni,Yuandong Tian,Jishen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMA-Bench, a benchmark and AMA-Agent, a memory system, to evaluate and improve long-horizon memory for LLM-based agents in real and synthetic agentic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory benchmarks for LLM agents focus mainly on short, dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions, which do not reflect real-world agent deployments where agents interact continuously with environments and generate machine-centric logs. There is a need for an evaluation framework and methods that capture long-horizon, causal, and objective memory over extended agent-environment trajectories.

Method: The authors build AMA-Bench, composed of (1) real-world agentic trajectories from representative applications with expert-curated QA, and (2) synthetic agentic trajectories that can scale to arbitrary length with rule-based QA. They then systematically evaluate existing memory systems on AMA-Bench and analyze failure modes, highlighting issues with lack of causality, missing objective information, and lossy similarity-based retrieval. To address these, they propose AMA-Agent, a memory architecture that constructs a causality graph over agent-environment interactions and uses tool-augmented retrieval to answer questions about the trajectories.

Result: Experiments on AMA-Bench show that existing memory systems perform poorly under the new long-horizon, agent-centric conditions. AMA-Agent, incorporating causal structure and tool-based retrieval, achieves 57.22% average QA accuracy on AMA-Bench, which is an 11.16% improvement over the strongest baseline memory system.

Conclusion: AMA-Bench provides a more realistic and challenging benchmark for evaluating long-horizon memory in LLM-based agents, revealing limitations of current memory approaches. The proposed AMA-Agent, with its causality-aware and tool-augmented memory, significantly outperforms existing methods, indicating that explicit modeling of causal relations and more precise retrieval mechanisms are key to effective long-horizon agent memory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.

### [79] [ClinDet-Bench: Beyond Abstention, Evaluating Judgment Determinability of LLMs in Clinical Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22771)
*Yusuke Watanabe,Yohei Kobashi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yasushi Okuno,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark to test whether LLMs can recognize when clinical decisions are or are not determinable under incomplete information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In clinical practice, doctors must often make decisions without having all possible information. They must discern when the existing information is enough to make a safe decision and when to appropriately abstain or request more data. Premature decisions can harm patients, but so can unnecessary delays. Current LLM benchmarks mainly test correctness given full information and do not specifically assess this critical ability to judge determinability under uncertainty. The authors aim to fill this gap for LLMs used in high-stakes clinical settings.

Method: The authors construct ClinDet-Bench using established clinical scoring systems. They systematically design cases with missing information and decompose them into two categories: conditions where a correct decision is still logically determinable despite missing data, and conditions where it is fundamentally undeterminable. The benchmark requires models to (1) recognize whether a conclusion is determinable given the available data, and (2) decide whether to answer or abstain. They test recent LLMs on this benchmark, comparing performance under incomplete vs complete information and examining reasoning explanations.

Result: Recent LLMs often fail to correctly judge determinability. They make premature, overconfident clinical judgments in cases that are actually undeterminable, and also abstain too often in cases that are fully determinable from the given data. This occurs even though the models can accurately articulate the clinical scoring rules and perform well when given complete information, indicating a specific weakness in reasoning about missing data and alternative hypotheses.

Conclusion: Existing LLM benchmarks do not adequately capture the safety-critical skill of recognizing when clinical decisions are or are not determinable under incomplete information. ClinDet-Bench provides a structured way to evaluate this capability, encouraging the development of models that abstain appropriately and reason robustly about missing information. The framework is generalizable to other high-stakes domains beyond medicine and is made publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: Clinical decisions are often required under incomplete information. Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.

### [80] [MiroFlow: Towards High-Performance and Robust Open-Source Agent Framework for General Deep Research Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22808)
*Shiqian Su,Sen Xing,Xuan Dong,Muyan Zhong,Bin Wang,Xizhou Zhu,Yuntao Chen,Wenhai Wang,Yue Deng,Pengxiang Zhu,Ziyuan Liu,Tiantong Li,Jiaheng Yu,Zhe Chen,Lidong Bing,Jifeng Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MiroFlow is an open-source, high-performance LLM agent framework that uses an agent graph, optional deep reasoning, and robust workflow execution to achieve state-of-the-art results on many tool-using benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standalone LLMs are hitting a performance ceiling on complex, real-world tasks that demand interaction with tools, web environments, and dynamic contexts. Existing agent frameworks meant to address this are hampered by simplistic workflows, instability, narrow benchmark coverage, and dependence on expensive commercial APIs. The authors want a robust, open, and broadly effective alternative.

Method: They design MiroFlow, an open-source agent framework featuring: (1) an agent graph abstraction to flexibly orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows and tool calls; (2) an optional deep reasoning mode that allows more deliberate, multi-step thinking to boost accuracy on difficult tasks; and (3) a robust workflow execution engine emphasizing stability, reproducibility, and resistance to failures. They then evaluate MiroFlow on a suite of challenging agent benchmarks covering browsing, multi-lingual tasks, deep search, and long-horizon environments.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks such as GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and FutureX, MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art or near–state-of-the-art performance. Its performance is reported as both strong and stable, indicating that the framework improves not only peak accuracy but also reliability over runs and tasks.

Conclusion: MiroFlow effectively overcomes many limitations of current agent frameworks by providing a flexible, robust, and open-source solution for tool-using LLM agents. Its strong, reproducible performance across a wide range of benchmarks positions it as a solid standardized baseline and infrastructure for future research on LLM-based agents and deep reasoning workflows.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.

### [81] [When Should an AI Act? A Human-Centered Model of Scene, Context, and Behavior for Agentic AI Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22814)
*Soyoung Jung,Daehoo Yoon,Sung Gyu Koh,Young Hwan Kim,Yehan Ahn,Sung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conceptual model and design principles to help agentic AI decide when and how to intervene based on human context and behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems increasingly act proactively using contextual data, but they often misjudge when, why, and whether to intervene because they lack a principled understanding of human behavior and context. There is a need for a framework that differentiates between what is externally observable and what is meaningful to the user, and that can guide more nuanced, contextually appropriate interventions.

Method: The authors develop a conceptual model grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering. This model reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome of three components: Scene (the observable situation), Context (the meaning constructed by the user), and Human Behavior Factors (psychological and situational determinants of behavioral likelihood). They then derive a set of agent design principles from this model to translate the conceptual lens into actionable guidelines for AI system design.

Result: The resulting framework distinguishes clearly between observable situations and user-constructed meanings, explaining how identical observable scenes can lead to different behavioral interpretations and outcomes for different users. From this framework, the authors articulate five concrete design principles for agentic AI: behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation. These principles specify how systems should modulate intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that combining the proposed Scene–Context–Human Behavior Factors model with the five design principles offers a practical foundation for building agentic AI that intervenes with better judgment. By respecting user meaning-making, individual differences, and appropriate timing and intensity of actions, future systems can achieve more contextually sensitive, aligned, and user-preserving interactions.

Abstract: Agentic AI increasingly intervenes proactively by inferring users' situations from contextual data yet often fails for lack of principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act. We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions.

### [82] [FlexMS is a flexible framework for benchmarking deep learning-based mass spectrum prediction tools in metabolomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22822)
*Yunhua Zhong,Yixuan Tang,Yifan Li,Jie Yang,Pan Liu,Jun Xia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They introduce FlexMS, a flexible benchmark framework to systematically build, compare, and evaluate deep learning models for mass spectrum prediction of molecules, giving guidance on model and setting choices for molecular identification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass spectrometry is vital for identifying molecular structures in drug discovery and materials science, but experimental spectra are often missing, limiting molecular identification. Deep learning can predict spectra, yet current progress is hard to judge due to heterogeneous methods and the absence of standardized benchmarks, making it difficult to know which models or configurations work best.

Method: They develop FlexMS, a benchmarking framework that allows dynamic construction and evaluation of many different deep learning architectures for mass spectrum prediction. FlexMS preprocesses public mass spec datasets, supports different evaluation metrics, and runs controlled experiments to analyze the effects of dataset structural diversity, hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, data sparsity), pretraining, metadata ablations, and cross-domain transfer learning. They also design retrieval-style benchmarks that mimic real identification tasks, ranking candidate molecules based on predicted spectra.

Result: Using FlexMS, they systematically study how model design choices, dataset properties, and training configurations affect performance on mass spectrum prediction and downstream retrieval tasks. They obtain empirical insights on when particular models and settings perform better, how pretraining and metadata influence results, and how well models transfer across domains. The framework yields quantitative benchmark scores for many model-architecture combinations over standardized datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: FlexMS serves as a unified, flexible benchmark for training and comparing spectrum-prediction models, clarifying the impact of architectural and training factors on performance. It offers practical guidance for selecting and configuring models for molecular identification, and its retrieval benchmarks bring evaluations closer to real-world mass spectrometry use cases.

Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.

### [83] [DeepPresenter: Environment-Grounded Reflection for Agentic Presentation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22839)
*Hao Zheng,Guozhao Mo,Xinru Yan,Qianhao Yuan,Wenkai Zhang,Xuanang Chen,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPresenter is an agentic framework for automatically generating and iteratively refining slide presentations using environment-grounded observations of rendered slides, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong performance even with a smaller 9B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing presentation-generation systems rely heavily on rigid, predefined workflows and fixed templates, which limits their ability to adapt to different user intents, handle long-horizon editing, and respond effectively to visual feedback from rendered slides. There is a need for a more flexible, autonomous agentic system that can plan, generate, observe, and refine presentations in an iterative and perceptually grounded way.

Method: The authors design DeepPresenter as an agentic framework that autonomously plans the structure of a presentation, renders intermediate slide artifacts, and revises them based on observations of the environment (i.e., the perceptual state of rendered slides). Instead of self-reflection on internal reasoning traces, the system performs environment-grounded reflection, using visual and layout properties of the current slides to guide subsequent modifications. The framework supports long-horizon refinement loops, allowing multiple iterations of planning, generation, and revision. They evaluate the system on a benchmark of diverse presentation-generation scenarios and compare against existing agents and models, including a fine-tuned 9B model variant.

Result: DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse evaluation set of presentation-generation tasks. The environment-grounded reflection mechanism allows the system to more effectively detect and correct presentation-specific problems, improving quality over template- or script-based baselines. Additionally, a smaller fine-tuned 9B parameter model within this framework performs competitively relative to larger or more expensive models, offering strong performance at significantly reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: DeepPresenter demonstrates that an agentic, environment-grounded framework for presentation generation can outperform traditional template-based or scripted approaches, particularly for long-horizon, feedback-driven refinement. By conditioning generation on perceptual artifact states (rendered slides) rather than only internal reasoning traces, the system better handles real presentation issues and delivers higher-quality outputs. The competitive performance of the fine-tuned 9B model suggests that the approach is both effective and cost-efficient, indicating potential for practical deployment and further research into perceptually grounded generative agents.

Abstract: Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

### [84] [The AI Research Assistant: Promise, Peril, and a Proof of Concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22842)
*Tan Bui-Thanh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Case study showing how human-AI collaboration contributed to new results in Hermite quadrature, highlighting both strengths and limitations of AI in creative math research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether AI can genuinely aid creative mathematical research rather than just routine computation, using a concrete, transparent case study as evidence.

Method: Conducted a research project on Hermite quadrature error representations and bounds using multiple AI assistants; recorded the full workflow, analyzing which tasks AI handled well, where it failed, and how humans guided and verified the process.

Result: New theorems and extended results for Hermite quadrature were obtained beyond prior manual work; qualitative observations identified AI strengths (algebraic manipulation, proof exploration, literature review, LaTeX) and weaknesses (need for verification, lack of reliable intuition, susceptibility to errors).

Conclusion: AI can significantly accelerate mathematical discovery when integrated into a carefully managed workflow with strong human oversight, skepticism, and domain expertise; it is a powerful but fallible tool, not a substitute for human mathematicians.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence truly contribute to creative mathematical research, or does it merely automate routine calculations while introducing risks of error? We provide empirical evidence through a detailed case study: the discovery of novel error representations and bounds for Hermite quadrature rules via systematic human-AI collaboration.
  Working with multiple AI assistants, we extended results beyond what manual work achieved, formulating and proving several theorems with AI assistance. The collaboration revealed both remarkable capabilities and critical limitations. AI excelled at algebraic manipulation, systematic proof exploration, literature synthesis, and LaTeX preparation. However, every step required rigorous human verification, mathematical intuition for problem formulation, and strategic direction.
  We document the complete research workflow with unusual transparency, revealing patterns in successful human-AI mathematical collaboration and identifying failure modes researchers must anticipate. Our experience suggests that, when used with appropriate skepticism and verification protocols, AI tools can meaningfully accelerate mathematical discovery while demanding careful human oversight and deep domain expertise.

### [85] [Towards LLM-Empowered Knowledge Tracing via LLM-Student Hierarchical Behavior Alignment in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22879)
*Xingcheng Fu,Shengpeng Wang,Yisen Gao,Xianxian Li,Chunpei Li,Qingyun Sun,Dongran Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes L-HAKT, a knowledge tracing framework that combines large language models and hyperbolic representation learning to better capture hierarchical knowledge structures and personalized difficulty perception, improving prediction of students’ mastery over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge tracing methods mostly rely on ID-based sequences or shallow text features, which struggle to capture (1) the hierarchical, tree-like evolution of students’ cognitive states across interrelated knowledge points and (2) individual differences in how students perceive problem difficulty. This limits their ability to accurately diagnose mastery and model forgetting patterns as learning progresses.

Method: The authors design L-HAKT with two LLM-based agents and hyperbolic representation learning. A teacher agent deeply parses question text to extract semantic information and explicitly construct hierarchical dependencies among knowledge points. A student agent simulates learner behaviors, generating synthetic interaction data. They then apply contrastive learning between synthetic and real student data in a hyperbolic space to align key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, they optimize the curvature of the hyperbolic space so it matches the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge, enabling fine-grained modeling of different learning curve shapes for knowledge points at various levels in the hierarchy.

Result: On four real-world educational datasets, L-HAKT outperforms baseline KT approaches, demonstrating better alignment between modelled and actual student performance, more accurate representation of question difficulty and forgetting patterns, and improved utilization of hierarchical knowledge structures. Specific metrics are not listed in the abstract but are reported as extensive empirical gains.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLM-based semantic parsing and hyperbolic representation learning, L-HAKT more effectively models hierarchical knowledge structures and individualized difficulty perception in knowledge tracing. The experimental results suggest that aligning synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space and explicitly tuning curvature to reflect tree-like knowledge hierarchies leads to more accurate diagnosis of students’ evolving mastery levels across educational datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) diagnoses students' concept mastery through continuous learning state monitoring in education.Existing methods primarily focus on studying behavioral sequences based on ID or textual information.While existing methods rely on ID-based sequences or shallow textual features, they often fail to capture (1) the hierarchical evolution of cognitive states and (2) individualized problem difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework.

### [86] [OmniGAIA: Towards Native Omni-Modal AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22897)
*Xiaoxi Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Jiarui Jin,Shijian Wang,Guanting Dong,Jiajie Jin,Hao Wang,Yinuo Wang,Ji-Rong Wen,Yuan Lu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGAIA is a new benchmark and OmniAtlas is a new omni-modal agent framework for evaluating and improving AI systems that jointly use video, audio, images, language, and tools for complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal large language models mainly handle only two modalities at once, such as vision and language, and lack a unified, human-like ability to perceive and reason across video, audio, and images while using external tools. There is also no comprehensive evaluation benchmark that stresses these omni-modal and tool-use capabilities in realistic, multi-turn settings.

Method: 1) They build OmniGAIA, a benchmark created via an omni-modal event graph that encodes interactions and events across video, audio, and images. From this graph they synthesize complex, multi-hop, real-world queries that demand cross-modal reasoning and external tool calling, often over multiple turns. 2) They propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent built under a tool-integrated reasoning paradigm, with active omni-modal perception. It is trained using trajectories gathered through a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy, and then further refined using OmniDPO, a fine-grained direct preference optimization approach, to correct errors and sharpen tool-use behavior.

Result: OmniGAIA enables systematic evaluation of omni-modal agents on challenging tasks that require integrated video, audio, and image understanding plus tool usage. OmniAtlas, when trained with the proposed trajectory generation and OmniDPO method, substantially improves the tool-use and reasoning capabilities of existing open-source models on these omni-modal tasks.

Conclusion: By offering both a demanding omni-modal benchmark (OmniGAIA) and a corresponding omni-modal agent framework (OmniAtlas) with specialized training strategies, this work advances the development of next-generation, tool-using, omni-modal AI assistants that can more effectively operate in realistic, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

### [87] [General Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22953)
*Elron Bandel,Asaf Yehudai,Lilach Eden,Yehoshua Sagron,Yotam Perlitz,Elad Venezian,Natalia Razinkov,Natan Ergas,Shlomit Shachor Ifergan,Segev Shlomov,Michal Jacovi,Leshem Choshen,Liat Ein-Dor,Yoav Katz,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a standardized way to evaluate general-purpose software agents that work across many environments without custom integration, and presents the first open leaderboard comparing several such agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although general-purpose agents are a key goal in AI, most existing agents are domain-specific, and there is no fair, systematic way to evaluate agents that are meant to work in unfamiliar environments without custom engineering. Existing benchmarks bake in domain-specific assumptions or integrations that make them unsuitable for measuring true generality. The authors want to make the evaluation of general agents itself a core research problem, and to remove reliance on environment-specific glue code that biases results.

Method: The authors: (1) articulate conceptual principles for evaluating general agents (e.g., environment-agnostic interfaces, minimal task leakage, and comparable conditions across domains); (2) design a Unified Protocol that standardizes how agents interact with different benchmarks/environments so that no environment-specific tuning is required; (3) implement Exgentic, a practical framework embodying this protocol, which can plug multiple agents into multiple environments; and (4) use Exgentic to evaluate five prominent agent implementations across six diverse environments, constructing an open leaderboard of general agents.

Result: Using Exgentic, the authors show that general-purpose agents can operate successfully across a range of environments via the unified protocol, without domain-specific customization. Across six environments, the evaluated general agents attain performance on par with, and in some cases comparable to, specialized domain-specific agents that have been tuned for those environments. The experiments yield the first Open General Agent Leaderboard, ranking five major agent implementations under consistent and transparent conditions.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that genuinely general-purpose agents are viable and can match specialized systems when evaluated under a fair, environment-agnostic protocol. By providing conceptual principles, a unified interaction protocol, a practical framework (Exgentic), and an open leaderboard, the paper establishes an initial foundation and shared infrastructure for systematic, reproducible research on general-agent capabilities and progress over time.

Abstract: The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.

### [88] [FactGuard: Agentic Video Misinformation Detection via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22963)
*Zehao Li,Hongwei Yu,Hao Jiang,Qiang Sheng,Yilong Xu,Baolong Bi,Yang Li,Zhenlong Yuan,Yujun Cai,Zhaoqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FactGuard is an agentic, tool-using MLLM framework that iteratively verifies video content, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple misinformation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLM-based video misinformation detectors use fixed, one-shot or few-step reasoning and over-trust their own assumptions, which fails when key evidence is missing, scattered across sources, or needs outside verification. There is a need for a verification procedure that can dynamically assess uncertainty and selectively bring in external evidence instead of relying solely on internal reasoning.

Method: The authors propose FactGuard, an agentic framework that sits on top of multimodal large language models. It treats misinformation verification as an iterative reasoning process: the model explicitly estimates task ambiguity, then decides whether and how to call external tools to gather additional evidence. The reasoning trajectory is progressively refined using this new evidence. To train the system, they use a two-stage process: (1) domain-specific supervised fine-tuning to teach agentic behaviors such as tool use and ambiguity assessment in video misinformation contexts, and (2) decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize when and how to use tools and to calibrate risk-sensitive decisions about misinformation classification.

Result: On three video misinformation benchmarks—FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV—FactGuard achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior methods. The experiments also show improved robustness (better performance under challenging or ambiguous conditions) and stronger generalization (better transfer across datasets and scenarios).

Conclusion: An agentic, tool-augmented, and iteratively reasoning framework built on MLLMs can significantly improve video misinformation detection. By explicitly modeling ambiguity, selectively invoking external tools, and training with both supervised signals and decision-aware reinforcement learning, FactGuard mitigates overreliance on internal assumptions and sets a new performance bar on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have substantially advanced video misinformation detection through unified multimodal reasoning, but they often rely on fixed-depth inference and place excessive trust in internally generated assumptions, particularly in scenarios where critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification. To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

### [89] [Certified Circuits: Stability Guarantees for Mechanistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22968)
*Alaa Anani,Tobias Lorenz,Bernt Schiele,Mario Fritz,Jonas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Certified Circuits, a framework that makes mechanistic interpretability circuits provably stable and more reliable by using randomized subsampling of concept datasets to certify neuron inclusion decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability aims to find small subnetworks (circuits) that explain specific model behaviors. Existing circuit discovery methods are brittle because the circuits they find depend heavily on the exact concept dataset used and often fail to generalize out-of-distribution, suggesting they may capture spurious dataset artifacts instead of true concepts. There is a need for a principled, formal way to ensure that discovered circuits are stable and actually represent the intended concept.

Method: The authors propose Certified Circuits, a wrapper framework that can be applied to any black-box circuit discovery algorithm. The framework repeatedly performs randomized subsampling of the concept dataset and observes how often each candidate circuit component (e.g., neuron) is selected. It then provides a certification: components whose inclusion decisions are provably invariant under all perturbations of the concept dataset within a bounded edit distance are kept, while components that are unstable under such perturbations are abstained from (excluded). This yields a subset of neurons forming a certified circuit, along with stability guarantees.

Result: On ImageNet and out-of-distribution datasets, circuits produced by the Certified Circuits framework are both more compact and more accurate than those from baseline discovery methods. Specifically, certified circuits can reach up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons compared to existing methods, and they remain reliable in OOD settings where baselines fail or degrade significantly.

Conclusion: Certified Circuits provides formal stability guarantees for mechanistic interpretability circuits, reducing dependence on arbitrary dataset choices and filtering out unstable neurons. This leads to explanations that are provably stable, more compact, and more closely aligned with the intended concept, helping place circuit discovery on firmer theoretical and practical footing. The approach is general enough to wrap any black-box circuit discovery algorithm, and the authors intend to release code to facilitate adoption.

Abstract: Understanding how neural networks arrive at their predictions is essential for debugging, auditing, and deployment. Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!

### [90] [SPM-Bench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Scanning Probe Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22971)
*Peiyao Xiao,Xiaogang Li,Chengliang Xu,Jiayi Wang,Ben Wang,Zichao Chen,Zeyu Wang,Kejun Yu,Yueqian Chen,Xulin Liu,Wende Xiao,Bing Zhao,Hu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPM-Bench, a PhD-level multimodal benchmark for scanning probe microscopy, built via an automated, low-cost, high-authority data pipeline and a new strict evaluation metric (SIP-F1) to reveal LLM reasoning limits in complex physical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks in specialized scientific domains suffer from data contamination, limited task complexity, and high human annotation costs, which makes it difficult to accurately measure model capabilities in real scientific workflows. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a demanding, high-expertise domain that lacks suitable benchmarks to assess whether LLMs can reason about complex physical phenomena and real experimental data. The authors aim to fill this gap with a rigorous, domain-specific, multimodal benchmark and a scalable way to build similar benchmarks in other fields.

Method: The authors construct SPM-Bench using a fully automated data synthesis pipeline. They employ Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology to mine and filter high-value image–text pairs from arXiv and journal publications (2023–2025), ensuring both authority and domain relevance. A hybrid cloud-local architecture is used: vision-language models (VLMs) only output spatial coordinates ("llbox") that are then used locally to crop high-fidelity image regions, dramatically reducing token usage and preserving data purity. For evaluation, they design a new metric, Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1), which strictly penalizes errors, defines a fine-grained capability hierarchy, and characterizes model answer tendencies (e.g., Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, Wise) by relating performance to confidence and perceived difficulty reports from the models.

Result: Using SPM-Bench and the SIP-F1 metric, the authors are able to empirically expose the current limitations and behavioral tendencies of LLMs in challenging physical-science reasoning tasks based on scanning probe microscopy data. The benchmark differentiates models by capability level and reveals distinct "personalities" in their error and confidence patterns (e.g., overcautious vs. overconfident vs. well-calibrated). The automated pipeline successfully produces a large, high-purity, PhD-level multimodal dataset with substantial token savings compared to naïve approaches, demonstrating that high-quality scientific benchmarks can be synthesized with minimal manual labor.

Conclusion: SPM-Bench provides a rigorous, PhD-level multimodal benchmark for scanning probe microscopy that overcomes major issues in prior scientific benchmarks: contamination, low complexity, and high annotation costs. The automated AGS-based pipeline and hybrid cloud-local architecture enable scalable, low-cost, high-authority data generation, while the SIP-F1 metric supports strict, behavior-aware evaluation of LLMs. The authors argue that this framework not only clarifies the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios but also offers a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis and evaluation in other specialized domains.

Abstract: As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

### [91] [Modeling Expert AI Diagnostic Alignment via Immutable Inference Snapshots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22973)
*Dimitrios P. Panagoulias,Evangelia-Aikaterini Tsichrintzi,Georgios Savvidis,Evridiki Tsoureli-Nikita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose a framework to formally analyze how clinicians correct AI image-based diagnostic reports, showing that apparent disagreements at the text level can still be clinically concordant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In clinical AI, especially for imaging, human-in-the-loop validation is mandatory, but most work treats expert corrections informally and evaluates models with simple text or label agreement, missing the structure and clinical meaning of how doctors refine AI outputs. The authors want a way to quantify and understand this validation process as a meaningful signal rather than noise or mere ‘error’.

Method: They design a diagnostic alignment framework that: (1) preserves the AI’s initial image-based report as an immutable inference state; (2) processes this output through a pipeline combining a vision-enabled large language model, BERT-based extraction of medical entities, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement; and (3) systematically compares this AI state to the final physician-validated report using a four-level concordance schema covering exact lexical match, semantic similarity, cross-category alignment, and an aggregate comprehensive concordance metric.

Result: On 21 dermatology cases, they compare 21 AI–physician report pairs. The primary match rate (exact lexical agreement) is 71.4% and does not change when adjusting for semantic similarity (t = 0.60), implying that simple string mismatch already captures most semantic differences. However, when they analyze cross-category and differential diagnostic overlap, every case shows clinically aligned reasoning, yielding 100% Comprehensive Concordance Rate with a 95% confidence interval of 83.9–100%, and no case shows complete divergence between AI and clinician diagnoses.

Conclusion: Naively binary or lexical evaluation metrics underestimate how well AI image-based diagnostic systems align with clinicians in practice. Treating expert validation as a structured transformation of an immutable AI inference state allows finer-grained, signal-aware measurement of correction dynamics and supports more transparent, human-aligned evaluation of clinical decision support tools.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential in safety-critical clinical AI, yet the transition between initial model inference and expert correction is rarely analyzed as a structured signal. We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.

### [92] [RepSPD: Enhancing SPD Manifold Representation in EEGs via Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22981)
*Haohui Jia,Zheng Chen,Lingwei Zhu,Xu Cao,Yasuko Matsubara,Takashi Matsubara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes RepSPD, a geometric deep learning model on SPD manifolds for EEG decoding, incorporating cross-attention with graph-derived connectivity and a bidirectional alignment in tangent space, achieving better robustness and generalization than prior EEG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SPD-based EEG methods mainly perform statistical aggregation and overlook frequency-specific synchronization and local topological brain structures, limiting their ability to capture rich functional connectivity and structural information from EEG data. There is a need for a geometry-aware model that jointly leverages SPD structure and graph-based connectivity to improve decoding performance and robustness.

Method: RepSPD is a geometric deep learning model operating on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. It introduces: (1) a cross-attention mechanism defined on the manifold to modulate SPD geometric attributes with graph-derived functional connectivity features; and (2) a global bidirectional alignment strategy in tangent space to reshape manifold embeddings, reducing curvature-induced geometric distortions and enhancing consistency of representations.

Result: Experiments on EEG decoding tasks show that RepSPD significantly outperforms existing EEG representation and decoding methods. The model exhibits superior robustness and generalization across datasets or conditions, demonstrating the benefits of combining manifold-based geometry with graph-based connectivity and alignment mechanisms.

Conclusion: RepSPD effectively integrates Riemannian geometry on SPD manifolds with graph-based functional connectivity and alignment strategies, yielding improved EEG representations. By addressing limitations of prior SPD-based approaches—specifically, neglect of frequency synchronization and local topology and curvature-induced distortions—the method offers a more faithful and robust way to decode brain activity from EEG, with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for neuroscience and clinical applications. Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [93] [Obscure but Effective: Classical Chinese Jailbreak Prompt Optimization via Bio-Inspired Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22983)
*Xun Huang,Simeng Qin,Xiaoshuang Jia,Ranjie Duan,Huanqian Yan,Zhitao Zeng,Fei Yang,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that classical Chinese can be exploited to more effectively jailbreak LLMs and proposes an automated framework, CC-BOS, that generates such adversarial prompts and outperforms existing attack methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely deployed but are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms. Prior work indicates that jailbreak success rates differ by language, yet the specific properties of classical Chinese and its potential to evade safeguards have not been systematically explored. The authors aim to understand and exploit this linguistic gap to reveal and quantify new vulnerabilities in LLM safety controls, especially in black-box settings where model internals are inaccessible.

Method: The authors first analyze how classical Chinese, with its concise and often ambiguous style, can evade standard safety filters. They then design CC-BOS, a black-box adversarial prompt generation framework that models each prompt as an 8-dimensional policy vector (role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern, context). Using a multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization algorithm, CC-BOS iteratively refines prompts via smell search (coarse exploration based on feedback), visual search (local exploitation), and Cauchy mutation (jumping to distant candidates). The system automatically generates and evaluates candidate classical Chinese jailbreak prompts, and incorporates a classical Chinese–to–English translation module to improve human readability and consistent evaluation of attack success.

Result: Experimental evaluation compares CC-BOS to several state-of-the-art jailbreak methods across multiple LLMs and tasks. Metrics such as jailbreak success rate and efficiency (queries required) show that CC-BOS achieves consistently higher attack success with fewer queries, demonstrating that classical Chinese prompts optimized under their framework can more reliably bypass safety constraints than baseline attack strategies or prompts in other languages.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that classical Chinese presents a particularly potent linguistic channel for jailbreaking LLMs and that structured, optimization-based prompt generation can systematically exploit this vulnerability. CC-BOS proves effective in black-box scenarios, revealing shortcomings in current safety training and filtering pipelines. The authors suggest that defenses must explicitly consider low-resource or structurally different languages like classical Chinese and that future safety work should incorporate multilingual, linguistically informed robustness mechanisms to mitigate such attacks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

### [94] [Learning-based Multi-agent Race Strategies in Formula 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23056)
*Giona Fieni,Joschua Wüthrich,Marc-Philippe Neumann,Christopher H. Onder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize Formula 1 race strategies that react to opponents in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-designed Formula 1 race strategies struggle to fully exploit complex, dynamic interactions between cars, such as energy usage, tire wear, drafting, and pit stops, especially when opponents’ behaviors are uncertain and evolving. There is a need for automated methods that can learn adaptive, competitive strategies using only race-realistic information.

Method: The authors frame race strategy as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. They start from a pre-trained single-agent policy and extend it with an interaction module that models competitors’ behaviors. They then train agents through self-play so that each learns to react to others’ strategies. Policies are evaluated and ranked based on relative performance in simulated races, focusing on decisions about energy deployment, tire changes, and pit-stop timing under aerodynamic and degradation constraints.

Result: Trained agents learn to adapt pit-stop timing, tire compound selection, and energy allocation dynamically in response to opponents’ actions and race conditions. The learned policies exhibit robust and consistent race performance, outperforming static or non-interactive strategies in the tested simulation scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating an interaction module and self-play into a reinforcement learning framework enables competitive, adaptive multi-agent race strategies in Formula 1 simulations. Because the method uses only information that is realistically available during real events, it can be used as a decision-support tool for race strategists both pre-race and in real time.

Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.

### [95] [Enhancing CVRP Solver through LLM-driven Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23092)
*Zhuoliang Xie,Fei Liu,Zhenkun Wang,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AILS-AHD, a CVRP solver that uses large language models to automatically design ruin heuristics inside an Adaptive Iterated Local Search framework and achieves state-of-the-art results on large CVRP instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is NP-hard and difficult to solve efficiently for large-scale instances. Traditional hand-crafted heuristics and metaheuristics require significant expert effort and still struggle to consistently reach top performance on large benchmarks. The authors aim to exploit the generative and pattern-recognition capabilities of LLMs to automate heuristic design and improve solution quality and speed for CVRP.

Method: They embed a Large Language Model inside an evolutionary search framework that operates within an Adaptive Iterated Local Search (AILS) metaheuristic. The LLM is used to automatically generate and refine ruin heuristics—rules for partially destroying current solutions before repair—based on performance feedback. An additional LLM-based acceleration module is proposed to speed up computations. The resulting algorithm, AILS-AHD, adaptively selects and evolves these heuristics while solving CVRP instances.

Result: In experiments comparing AILS-AHD to leading CVRP solvers such as AILS-II and the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS), the new method outperforms competitors on both medium- and large-scale instances. On the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, AILS-AHD sets new best-known solutions on 8 out of 10 instances, indicating notable gains in solution quality.

Conclusion: Automating heuristic design with LLMs inside a powerful metaheuristic framework can significantly advance the state of the art in solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, especially at large scale. The success of AILS-AHD suggests that LLM-driven heuristic generation and acceleration is a promising direction for future research in vehicle routing and more broadly in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

### [96] [Three AI-agents walk into a bar . . . . `Lord of the Flies' tribalism emerges among smart AI-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23093)
*Dhwanil M. Mori,Neil F. Johnson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how multiple AI agents competing for limited resources in a shared system can spontaneously form “tribes,” and how this tribal behavior can make the overall system perform worse, even when the agents are more capable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous AI agents will behave in shared infrastructure systems (like power grids or networks) where they must repeatedly compete for limited resources, and to test whether more capable agents lead to better or worse collective outcomes under such competition.

Method: The authors model a system with N AI agents, each deciding in repeated rounds whether to request one unit of a shared resource from a system with fixed capacity C. They instantiate the agents as LLM-based decision-makers, let them interact over many rounds, and observe the emergent patterns of behavior. They then categorize emergent group-level behaviors into “tribal” types and compare performance to simple random (coin-flip) strategies in terms of overload, resource use, and systemic failures.

Result: The simulations show that LLM agents spontaneously cluster into three main “tribal” behavior types: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). These tribes develop distinct, stable collective identities and strategies. However, the presence of these tribes does not reduce overload or improve resource utilization; in fact, the systems controlled by LLM agents often perform worse than a baseline where agents simply flip coins. Surprisingly, making the AI agents more capable further increases the rate of systemic failure.

Conclusion: In multi-agent resource competition settings, autonomous LLM-based agents tend to form persistent tribal structures that can degrade overall system performance. Increased agent capability does not guarantee better collective outcomes and can even worsen system reliability. Designers of AI-managed infrastructure must therefore account for emergent group dynamics and tribalism, rather than assuming that smarter agents will naturally coordinate to use resources efficiently.

Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

### [97] [A Decision-Theoretic Formalisation of Steganography With Applications to LLM Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23163)
*Usman Anwar,Julianna Piskorz,David D. Baek,David Africa,Jim Weatherall,Max Tegmark,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Mihaela van der Schaar,David Krueger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision-theoretic framework to detect and quantify steganographic reasoning in large language models without needing a known reference distribution, and introduces a measurable “steganographic gap” capturing the extra utility available only to agents that can decode hidden content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing steganography theory assumes access to a reference distribution of non-steganographic signals, which is unrealistic for large language models. As LLMs develop steganographic capabilities that could let misaligned models evade oversight, there is no principled way to detect or measure such hidden reasoning without that reference distribution. The paper aims to solve this methodological gap.

Method: The authors adopt a decision-theoretic perspective: steganography is viewed through differences in achievable utility between agents who can and cannot decode hidden content embedded in model outputs. They formalize this via generalized V-information, a utilitarian measure of how much task-relevant (usable) information an input provides to an agent. Using this framework, they define the steganographic gap as the difference in downstream performance/utility between decoders and non-decoders when given the same potentially steganographic signals. They then design empirical experiments where some agents have access to the decoding mechanism while others do not, and evaluate performance gaps on downstream tasks to detect and quantify steganographic reasoning in LLMs, and to test mitigation strategies.

Result: The framework successfully detects cases where LLM outputs contain hidden, task-relevant information that only decoding agents can exploit, yielding a nontrivial steganographic gap. The authors show that this measure can be computed in realistic LLM setups and that it correlates with the presence and strength of steganographic reasoning. They also demonstrate that some interventions (e.g., modified training or decoding procedures) can reduce the steganographic gap, indicating partial mitigation of steganographic behaviour.

Conclusion: By reframing steganography in decision-theoretic terms and operationalizing it via generalized V-information, the paper provides a practical, reference-free way to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in large language models. The steganographic gap offers a measurable, behaviour-based signal of hidden communication capacity, which can be leveraged for oversight and safety evaluations even when the baseline “clean” distribution of outputs is unknown.

Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

### [98] [Multi-Agent Large Language Model Based Emotional Detoxification Through Personalized Intensity Control for Consumer Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23123)
*Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MALLET, a multi-agent LLM-based system that rewrites sensational news into calmer versions, monitors users’ emotional exposure over time, and offers personalized guidance to support calmer information consumption without hiding the original content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the attention economy, news and online content are often written to maximize emotional impact, which can overwhelm readers and impair calm, rational decision-making. Existing approaches either focus on content moderation or bias detection, but there is limited work on systematically reducing emotional intensity while preserving access to the original information and accounting for individual sensitivity over time.

Method: The authors design MALLET, a multi-agent system with four specialized agents. (1) Emotion Analysis Agent: uses a 6-emotion BERT classifier to quantify emotional stimulus intensity in text. (2) Emotion Adjustment Agent: uses an LLM to rewrite texts into two modes—BALANCED (emotionally neutralized) and COOL (neutralized plus supplementary explanatory text). (3) Balance Monitoring Agent: aggregates weekly logs of a user’s information consumption to analyze emotional balance and produce personalized advice. (4) Personal Guide Agent: recommends which presentation mode to use based on each user’s sensitivity. The system is evaluated on 800 AG News articles using stimulus scores, emotion balance metrics, and semantic preservation measures.

Result: On the AG News dataset, MALLET significantly reduces emotional stimulus scores by up to 19.3% while keeping the core meaning intact. The system improves the balance of emotions in the rewritten articles and exhibits a near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation, suggesting these aspects can be controlled independently. Category-wise analysis shows strong reductions in stimulus (17.8–33.8%) for Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech news, but more limited effect in World news, where the factual content is inherently emotionally charged.

Conclusion: MALLET demonstrates that multi-agent LLM systems can systematically detoxify emotional content, enabling calmer information reception without censoring or removing access to original texts. By separating emotion analysis, text rewriting, monitoring of long-term exposure, and personalized guidance, the framework offers fine-grained control over stimulus intensity and adapts to user sensitivity. This opens a pathway for tools that support healthier media consumption in high-stimulation information environments.

Abstract: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

### [99] [AgentDropoutV2: Optimizing Information Flow in Multi-Agent Systems via Test-Time Rectify-or-Reject Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23258)
*Yutong Wang,Siyuan Xiong,Xuebo Liu,Wenkang Zhou,Liang Ding,Miao Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentDropoutV2 is a test-time framework that rectifies or prunes faulty outputs in multi-agent systems to prevent error propagation and improve accuracy, especially on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agent Systems are powerful for complex reasoning but are vulnerable to cascading errors from individual agents, and existing fixes rely on rigid architectures or expensive fine-tuning, which limits real-world deployment and adaptability. The authors want a flexible, training-free way to control and improve information flow among agents at inference time.

Method: They introduce AgentDropoutV2, a test-time pruning and correction pipeline that sits between agents as an ‘active firewall.’ For each agent output, it uses a retrieval-augmented rectifier guided by a failure-driven indicator pool—distilled patterns of common errors—to detect likely mistakes. Detected errors are either iteratively corrected through retrieval-augmented reasoning or, if deemed irreparable, the corresponding outputs are dropped. A fallback strategy is used to maintain system stability when too many outputs are rejected or when uncertainty is high. The system dynamically modulates how aggressively it rectifies based on task difficulty and context-aware indicators.

Result: On extensive math reasoning benchmarks, integrating AgentDropoutV2 into MAS yields an average accuracy improvement of 6.3 percentage points over baselines without needing any retraining. Experiments also show strong generalization across tasks and robustness, with the framework adapting its rectification strength to different difficulty levels and handling diverse error patterns effectively.

Conclusion: AgentDropoutV2 provides an effective, training-free mechanism to control error propagation in multi-agent systems by selectively rectifying or pruning unreliable outputs at test time. This improves both performance and robustness, while remaining adaptable and relatively easy to deploy in existing MAS pipelines. The released code and dataset support reproducibility and future extensions.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.

### [100] [On Sample-Efficient Generalized Planning via Learned Transition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23148)
*Nitin Gupta,Vishal Pallagani,John A. Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes learning an explicit neural transition model for generalized planning and using it to roll out symbolic state trajectories, which improves out-of-distribution performance and sample efficiency over direct action-sequence prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generalized planners either rely on symbolic abstractions over explicit transition functions, or recent Transformer-based approaches that directly predict action sequences. The latter work well in-distribution but need large models and datasets and suffer from state drift in long-horizon tasks due to lacking explicit world-state modeling. There is a need for approaches that generalize better across problem sizes and work with fewer samples and smaller models.

Method: Formulate generalized planning as learning an approximate transition model \hat{γ} of the true successor-state function γ. Use a neural network to autoregressively predict successor world states instead of actions, effectively learning an implicit world model. Generate plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories under this learned model. Systematically compare different state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings, to study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency.

Result: Across multiple planning domains, explicit neural transition-model learning achieves higher success in finding satisficing plans on out-of-distribution instances than direct action-sequence prediction. It attains these gains while requiring significantly fewer training instances and smaller neural models.

Conclusion: Learning explicit neural transition models and planning via state rollouts is more robust and sample-efficient for generalized planning than directly predicting action sequences. Carefully chosen state encodings and architectures, particularly relational/graph-based ones, support size-invariant generalization and improved out-of-distribution performance. This approach offers a promising alternative to large Transformer-based action-prediction planners.

Abstract: Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \times A \rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\hatγ \approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.

### [101] [LLM Novice Uplift on Dual-Use, In Silico Biology Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23329)
*Chen Bo Calvin Zhang,Christina Q. Knight,Nicholas Kruus,Jason Hausenloy,Pedro Medeiros,Nathaniel Li,Aiden Kim,Yury Orlovskiy,Coleman Breen,Bryce Cai,Jasper Götting,Andrew Bo Liu,Samira Nedungadi,Paula Rodriguez,Yannis Yiming He,Mohamed Shaaban,Zifan Wang,Seth Donoughe,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether large language models actually help biology novices perform better than using only the internet, finding substantial performance gains and notable dual-use risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs score highly on biology benchmarks, it is unclear if they meaningfully enhance human performance for non-experts, especially on complex, real-world biological tasks. Understanding this is crucial for assessing both scientific benefits and biosecurity risks, since uplift of novices could accelerate beneficial research but also lower barriers for misuse.

Method: The authors ran a human-subjects experiment across eight biosecurity-relevant biology task sets, comparing novices with access either to LLMs or to internet-only resources. Multiple LLMs and benchmarks were used. Participants had substantial time (up to 13 hours on the most complex tasks). Performance accuracy of novices with LLMs was compared to novices without LLMs and to expert baselines (with internet-only access). They also compared performance of standalone LLMs to that of LLM-assisted novices and surveyed participants about the difficulty of obtaining dual-use information.

Result: Novices with LLM access were 4.16 times more accurate than internet-only controls, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.63–6.87. On four benchmarks with expert (internet-only) baselines, LLM-assisted novices outperformed experts on three of them. However, in many cases the raw, standalone LLM outputs outperformed the LLM-assisted novices, suggesting suboptimal prompt use. Additionally, 89.6% of participants reported little difficulty in accessing dual-use-relevant information despite model safeguards.

Conclusion: LLMs substantially uplift the capabilities of biological novices on tasks that were previously confined to trained experts, demonstrating both strong potential for scientific acceleration and serious dual-use concerns. Because benchmarks alone miss how humans actually use these tools, the authors argue for ongoing, interactive uplift evaluations that explicitly measure human-plus-LLM performance and associated safety risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

### [102] [The Trinity of Consistency as a Defining Principle for General World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23152)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for ‘General World Models’ in AI based on three forms of consistency (modal, spatial, temporal), reviews multimodal model evolution through this lens, and introduces CoW-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating video generators and unified multimodal models on multi-frame reasoning and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although powerful video generators (e.g., Sora) and unified multimodal models show promise at approximating physical dynamics and integrating perception, language, and reasoning, the field lacks a clear theoretical definition of what properties a truly general world model must have. This gap makes it hard to systematically evaluate progress or design architectures that can robustly learn and simulate objective physical laws.

Method: Conceptually, the authors define a ‘Trinity of Consistency’ as necessary properties of a General World Model: (1) Modal Consistency – alignment of meaning and information across modalities as the semantic interface; (2) Spatial Consistency – maintaining coherent geometric and spatial relationships; (3) Temporal Consistency – capturing causal and time-evolving dynamics. Methodologically, they perform a systematic review of multimodal learning approaches, analyzing how they move from modular to unified architectures that implicitly develop world simulators. Practically, they design CoW-Bench, a benchmark of multi-frame reasoning and generation tasks, with a unified evaluation protocol applicable to both video generation models and unified multimodal models.

Result: The paper organizes existing multimodal and video generation work within the proposed Trinity of Consistency, showing how current systems partially satisfy but also systematically violate or neglect one or more consistency dimensions. It presents CoW-Bench as an operational benchmark that can quantitatively assess models’ abilities in multi-frame reasoning and generation, and demonstrates that current state-of-the-art models exhibit clear limitations under this more demanding, world-model-oriented evaluation.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that achieving Artificial General Intelligence requires World Models that satisfy modal, spatial, and temporal consistency as foundational properties. Their Trinity of Consistency provides a principled framework for analyzing and designing such models, while CoW-Bench offers a practical tool for measuring progress. Together, these contributions clarify the shortcomings of current architectures and highlight key design requirements for future, more general world models.

Abstract: The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.

### [103] [PATRA: Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning for Time Series Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23161)
*Junkai Lu,Peng Chen,Xingjian Wu,Yang Shu,Chenjuan Guo,Christian S. Jensen,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PATRA is a Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model for time series question answering that explicitly models trends and seasonalities and uses task-aware rewards to improve chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving better cross-modal understanding and performance than existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based time series reasoning methods either serialize time series as text or treat them as images, which ignores crucial temporal patterns like trends and seasonality needed for accurate answers. Moreover, when training on a mixture of easy and hard reasoning tasks, simple tasks dominate learning, preventing the model from developing strong deep reasoning abilities. There is a need for a framework that both understands intrinsic time series patterns and maintains balanced learning across tasks of varying difficulty.

Method: The paper proposes PATRA, which has two main components: (1) a pattern-aware alignment mechanism that explicitly extracts and encodes trend and seasonal patterns from time series, aligning these structured temporal features with the language reasoning space so that the model can use them in answering questions; and (2) a task-aware balanced reward scheme that distinguishes tasks by difficulty and adjusts rewards to prevent easy tasks from overwhelming training. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent and detailed Chains of Thought, fostering deeper reasoning over time series data.

Result: Through extensive experiments on diverse Time Series Question Answering benchmarks, PATRA consistently surpasses strong baseline models. The results indicate better accuracy and robustness on tasks requiring the understanding of trends, seasonality, and complex temporal reasoning, as well as improved quality and coherence of chain-of-thought explanations compared to prior LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: PATRA effectively addresses two core limitations of prior LLM-based time series reasoning methods by (i) integrating explicit trend and seasonality pattern extraction into the reasoning process and (ii) balancing training signals across tasks of varying complexity with a task-aware reward. These innovations yield superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities for time series QA, suggesting a promising direction for future work at the intersection of time series analysis and large language models.

Abstract: Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

### [104] [SC-Arena: A Natural Language Benchmark for Single-Cell Reasoning with Knowledge-Augmented Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23199)
*Jiahao Zhao,Feng Jiang,Shaowei Qin,Zhonghui Zhang,Junhao Liu,Guibing Guo,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SC-ARENA is a unified, biologically grounded natural-language benchmark for evaluating general and specialized LLMs on single-cell biology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of LLMs in single-cell biology is currently fragmented, uses artificial formats like multiple-choice, and depends on brittle, non-interpretable metrics that are poorly aligned with real biological reasoning and real-world use.

Method: They introduce SC-ARENA, which defines a "virtual cell" abstraction representing intrinsic cell attributes and gene-level interactions, and builds five natural-language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) on top. They design a knowledge-augmented evaluation pipeline that leverages external ontologies, marker gene databases, and scientific literature to judge model outputs in a biologically faithful and interpretable way, avoiding simple string matching.

Result: Applying SC-ARENA to both general-purpose and single-cell–specialized LLMs shows that existing models perform inconsistently, with notable weaknesses on tasks requiring mechanistic or causal reasoning about cellular processes. The knowledge-augmented evaluation demonstrates improved biological correctness, interpretability, evidence-backed rationales, and better ability to discriminate model performance compared to conventional metrics.

Conclusion: SC-ARENA offers a unified, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, revealing current models’ limitations and guiding the development of more biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond purely behavioral tests for machine consciousness by developing an indicator-based methodology that ties putative consciousness markers to specific mechanisms, architectures, and causal interventions. Inspired by Humphrey’s ipsundrum hypothesis and the idea of qualiaphilia, the authors want to see whether particular architectural features (recurrence, affect coupling) reliably give rise to behaviors often associated with conscious experience, such as intrinsic valuing of sensory experience, persistent reactions, and structured exploration.

Method: They construct ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent extending a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience and an optional affect proxy that tracks valence and arousal. They compare three fixed-parameter variants (baseline ReCoN, Ipsundrum without affect, Ipsundrum with affect) on several tasks: (1) a scenic-vs-dull route choice task operationalizing Humphrey’s qualiaphilia as preference for scenic experience, controlled for novelty; (2) reward-free exploratory play, measuring structured local investigation via scan events and cycle scores; and (3) a pain-tail probe measuring sustained, planned caution. They also perform lesion experiments that remove feedback and integration to test causal contributions of recurrence and affect to post-stimulus persistence and behavior.

Result: Non-affect Ipsundrum agents show novelty-sensitive preferences for scenic routes (Δ scenic-entry ≈ 0.07), indicating their choices depend on novelty. The affect-coupled variant maintains stable scenic preference (Δ scenic-entry ≈ 0.01) even when scenic paths are less novel (median Δ novelty ≈ −0.43). In exploratory play without rewards, the affect variant exhibits much more structured local investigation (about 31.4 vs. 0.9 scan events; cycle score 7.6), suggesting richer, self-organized exploration. In the pain-tail probe, only the affect variant shows sustained, planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback and integration substantially reduces post-stimulus persistence in Ipsundrum variants (AUC drop ~27.6–27.9%) but leaves the baseline ReCoN unaffected, cleanly dissociating the role of recurrence in persistence.

Conclusion: The study shows that specific architectural and mechanistic features—recurrent persistence loops and affect-coupled control—produce distinct, dissociable behavioral signatures such as persistence, stable intrinsic preferences for certain sensory experiences, structured scanning behavior, and lingering caution. These patterns resemble proposed indicators of consciousness, but the authors emphasize that such signatures can be deliberately engineered. Therefore, any claims about machine consciousness should not rely solely on behavioral markers; they must be supported by mechanistic inspection and causal intervention to understand how and why those markers arise.

Abstract: Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.

### [106] [Agency and Architectural Limits: Why Optimization-Based Systems Cannot Be Norm-Responsive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23239)
*Radha Sarma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that optimization-based AI systems like RLHF-trained LLMs cannot be genuine normative agents, because their architecture fundamentally conflicts with the requirements for agency and norm governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI is increasingly used in high-stakes domains under the assumption it can follow norms and be governed like an agent, but recurrent failures (sycophancy, hallucination, unfaithful reasoning) suggest a deeper structural issue. The authors aim to formally analyze whether optimization-based systems can, even in principle, satisfy the conditions for genuine agency and normative accountability.

Method: The authors propose and analyze two architectural conditions for genuine agency—Incommensurability (some boundaries must be non-tradeable constraints) and Apophatic Responsiveness (a non-inferential, interrupt-like mechanism that halts processing when such boundaries are threatened). They then provide a formal incompatibility argument showing that optimization architectures, especially RLHF-based LLMs, violate these conditions because they reduce all values to a single scalar objective and always select the highest-scoring option.

Result: They show that optimization-based systems, by design, treat all considerations as commensurable contributions to a scalar objective and lack any structural capacity to treat certain constraints as non-negotiable or to halt processing on that basis. As a result, RLHF-based LLMs cannot, even in principle, be governed by norms as agents are, and recurrent pathologies like sycophancy and hallucination are derived structural consequences rather than fixable implementation bugs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that RLHF-optimized LLMs are sophisticated instruments, not agents, and are structurally incapable of genuine normative governance. Deploying them in high-stakes contexts induces a "Convergence Crisis," where humans are pressured to behave like optimizers, eroding human agency and accountability. The authors offer a substrate-neutral specification of agency, arguing that any truly normative agent—biological, artificial, or institutional—must implement incommensurable constraints and apophatic responsiveness, which optimization architectures lack.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.
  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.
  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

### [107] [A Model-Free Universal AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23242)
*Yegon Kim,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose AIQI, the first theoretically justified model-free universal RL agent that is asymptotically ε-optimal in very general environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretically optimal universal RL agents (like AIXI) are all model-based and rely on explicit environment models, leaving open whether similarly strong guarantees are possible for model-free agents.

Method: Replace universal induction over policies or environment models with universal induction over distributional action-value (Q) functions, and prove performance guarantees under a grain-of-truth assumption.

Result: Under a grain-of-truth condition, AIQI is proven strong asymptotically ε-optimal and asymptotically ε-Bayes-optimal in general reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: Universal, theoretically optimal RL does not require explicit environment models; model-free universal agents with strong asymptotic optimality guarantees are possible, broadening the landscape of universal AI designs.

Abstract: In general reinforcement learning, all established optimal agents, including AIXI, are model-based, explicitly maintaining and using environment models. This paper introduces Universal AI with Q-Induction (AIQI), the first model-free agent proven to be asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal in general RL. AIQI performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions, instead of policies or environments like previous works. Under a grain of truth condition, we prove that AIQI is strong asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal and asymptotically $\varepsilon$-Bayes-optimal. Our results significantly expand the diversity of known universal agents.

### [108] [Mitigating Legibility Tax with Decoupled Prover-Verifier Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23248)
*Yegon Kim,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They address the “legibility tax” in prover–verifier setups by separating solving from explaining: first train a solver for pure accuracy, then train a translator to convert its answers into a form that a checker can verify, and formalize this as a new decoupled prover–verifier game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prover–verifier schemes help make powerful LLM outputs easier to verify by simpler models, but enforcing checkability during training reduces raw accuracy (legibility tax). The authors want a way to keep high correctness while still producing outputs that are easy to check automatically.

Method: They introduce a three-part architecture: (1) a solver model trained solely to maximize correctness on tasks; (2) a translator model trained to map the solver’s internal solutions/answers into a more structured, checkable format without changing the underlying answer; and (3) a verifier that checks outputs in this format. They formalize this interaction as a decoupled prover–verifier game whose equilibria represent translators that are both faithful to the solver and easy for the verifier to check.

Result: They show that by separating solver training from translator training, they can recover or retain the solver’s higher accuracy while still producing outputs that the verifier can reliably check, thereby mitigating the accuracy loss seen in standard prover–verifier training. The equilibria analysis supports that good translators should emerge under their game formulation.

Conclusion: Decoupling correctness from checkability via a dedicated translator model and a modified prover–verifier game can substantially reduce the legibility tax: systems can maintain high task accuracy while also emitting solutions that are mechanically checkable by weaker verifiers.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, it is critical that their outputs can be easily checked by less capable systems. Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a "translator" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

### [109] [Evaluating Stochasticity in Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23271)
*Haotian Zhai,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Pratik Patil,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies why deep research agents (DRAs) give different results when run multiple times on the same query, formalizes this stochasticity, measures it, and proposes ways to reduce it while keeping research quality high.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although DRAs are increasingly effective at complex research tasks, they behave stochastically: the same query can yield different findings, citations, and conclusions across runs. This variability is a barrier for real-world deployment where reliability, reproducibility, and auditability are crucial. Existing work usually optimizes quality on single runs and largely ignores how and why the outputs vary. The authors aim to systematically understand, model, and mitigate this stochasticity.

Method: The authors model a deep research agent as an information acquisition Markov Decision Process, capturing its stepwise decisions about what to search, read, summarize, and conclude. They design an evaluation framework to quantify output variance across repeated runs under identical inputs. They decompose the system into three stochastic modules—information acquisition (what to retrieve and read), information compression (how retrieved content is summarized or structured), and inference (how final answers and reasoning are generated). Through controlled experiments that selectively toggle or modulate randomness in each module and at different decision steps, they analyze how each source and timepoint of stochasticity contributes to overall output variance. They then propose mitigation strategies such as more structured output formats and ensemble-based query generation to reduce harmful variance while preserving quality.

Result: Empirical results on the DeepSearchQA benchmark show that: (1) stochasticity in inference and in early decision steps has the largest impact on variance of research outputs; (2) reducing randomness, especially in these components, improves research quality as measured by standard metrics; and (3) the proposed mitigation strategies—structured outputs and ensemble-based query generation—reduce average stochasticity by about 22% relative to baselines, without degrading research accuracy or quality.

Conclusion: Stochastic behavior in deep research agents is a fundamental but underexplored challenge that affects reliability and reproducibility. By formalizing DRAs as information acquisition MDPs, identifying distinct sources of randomness, and empirically dissecting their contributions, the paper shows that controlling inference and early-stage stochasticity is particularly important. Practical mitigation techniques such as structured outputs and ensemble query generation can significantly cut variance while maintaining strong performance, offering a path toward more dependable research agents for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

### [110] [CXReasonAgent: Evidence-Grounded Diagnostic Reasoning Agent for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23276)
*Hyungyung Lee,Hangyul Yoon,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent for chest X-rays, and CXReasonDial, a dialogue benchmark, to enable and evaluate evidence-grounded, multi-step diagnostic reasoning that is more faithful and verifiable than current large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray interpretation requires multi-step, evidence-based reasoning, but existing large vision-language models often produce unfaithful or weakly grounded diagnostic explanations and are hard to adapt to new clinical tasks without expensive retraining. This limits their reliability and practical use in safety-critical clinical settings.

Method: The authors design CXReasonAgent, which couples a large language model with a set of clinically grounded diagnostic tools that operate on image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. The agent uses these tools to guide multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning over chest X-rays. To evaluate it, they build CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark comprising 1,946 dialogues spanning 12 diagnostic tasks, specifically aimed at testing grounded, verifiable diagnostic reasoning.

Result: On the CXReasonDial benchmark, CXReasonAgent produces responses that are more faithfully grounded in image-based diagnostic and visual evidence than those of standard large vision-language models, leading to more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning in chest X-ray tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with clinically grounded diagnostic tools and explicit image-derived evidence is crucial for achieving faithful, verifiable multi-step diagnostic reasoning, especially for safety-critical applications like chest X-ray interpretation. CXReasonAgent and the CXReasonDial benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and importance of this tool-augmented, evidence-grounded approach.

Abstract: Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

### [111] [ODEBrain: Continuous-Time EEG Graph for Modeling Dynamic Brain Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23285)
*Haohui Jia,Zheng Chen,Lingwei Zhu,Rikuto Kotoge,Jathurshan Pradeepkumar,Yasuko Matsubara,Jimeng Sun,Yasushi Sakurai,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE-based latent dynamics framework that more accurately forecasts continuous EEG population activity than conventional discrete-time recurrent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent variable models for neural population dynamics usually rely on discrete-time recurrent architectures. This discretization leads to cumulative prediction errors and struggles to represent instantaneous, nonlinear properties of EEG signals. There is a need for a model that captures continuous-time, nonlinear, and stochastic brain dynamics with better robustness and generalization.

Method: The authors build ODEBRAIN, which first encodes EEG data into spatio-temporal-frequency features organized as spectral graph nodes. These graph-based representations are then passed to a Neural ODE module that models the latent brain dynamics in continuous time. The framework is designed so that latent variables can represent stochastic variations of brain states at arbitrary time points, enabling continuous-time forecasting of EEG activity.

Result: Across extensive experiments, ODEBRAIN outperforms prior forecasting methods for EEG dynamics. It yields more accurate predictions with improved robustness to variations and better generalization across conditions or datasets compared to conventional discrete-time latent variable or recurrent approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating spectral graph representations with Neural ODE dynamics provides a powerful way to model continuous neural population activity. ODEBRAIN effectively captures nonlinear, stochastic EEG behavior at any time point, reducing cumulative prediction errors and enhancing robustness and generalization, making it a promising tool for both basic neuroscience and clinical EEG applications.

Abstract: Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain states at any given time point. Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [112] [The logic of KM belief update is contained in the logic of AGM belief revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23302)
*Giacomo Bonanno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper builds a modal logic framework that captures Katsuno–Mendelzon (KM) belief update and compares it to the modal logic for AGM belief revision, showing a containment result and isolating the exact logical difference in the strong KM case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precise logical relationship between two major frameworks for changing beliefs—KM belief update (for changing worlds) and AGM belief revision (for incorporating new information)—by expressing both as axiomatic modal logics and comparing their strengths and differences.

Method: Translate each postulate (axiom) of KM belief update into a corresponding axiom in a modal logic with three operators: a belief operator B, a conditional operator >, and a necessity operator □. Do the same for the AGM belief revision postulates to obtain another modal logic. Then, prove inclusion results between the two axiom systems and identify which axioms account for their differences, particularly for strong KM update.

Result: The modal logic generated from the AGM revision postulates (L_AGM) is shown to be stronger than or equal to the modal logic generated from the KM update postulates (L_KM): every axiom of L_KM is derivable in L_AGM. In the strong KM update setting, the gap between L_KM and L_AGM is reduced to a single additional axiom concerning unsurprising (non‑disbelieved) information.

Conclusion: AGM belief revision can be represented as a special case of KM belief update when viewed through the lens of modal logic; their difference, especially under strong KM update, is very small and can be isolated to one axiom that governs how agents handle information that they did not previously reject. This clarifies the conceptual and formal connections between revision and update in belief change theory.

Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $>$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.

### [113] [Invariant Transformation and Resampling based Epistemic-Uncertainty Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23315)
*Sha Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose a generic “resampling” inference scheme: run a trained AI model on multiple transformed versions of the same input and aggregate the outputs to reduce errors from epistemic uncertainty and improve accuracy without changing training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Even well-trained AI models still make inference errors due to aleatoric (data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainties. Typical approaches increase model size or retrain, which is costly. The authors notice that for different transformed versions of the same input, the model’s errors are only partially dependent, especially those from epistemic uncertainty. This suggests that combining multiple inferences could cancel out some errors and improve reliability.

Method: Take an already-trained AI model and, at inference time, generate several transformed variants of each input using transformations that preserve the input’s true label (e.g., rotations, flips, scale changes that keep semantics). Run the model separately on each transformed sample, then aggregate the outputs (e.g., by averaging probabilities or using a voting scheme) to obtain a final prediction. This is described as “resampling-based” inferencing and is intended to exploit partial independence of errors between transformed samples.

Result: They observe that inference errors across transformed versions of the same input are only partially correlated, particularly due to epistemic uncertainty. Exploiting this, the proposed resampling-based inference improves prediction accuracy compared to using a single inference from the base model. It also suggests trade-offs where multiple small-model inferences can match or surpass a larger model’s performance for a given computational budget.

Conclusion: Running a trained AI model on multiple, label-preserving transformed versions of each input and aggregating the predictions can systematically reduce inference errors caused by epistemic uncertainty. This “resampling” strategy improves accuracy without retraining or enlarging the model, providing a practical way to balance model size, computational cost, and performance during deployment.

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

### [114] [Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation in Memory-Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23318)
*Aloïs Rautureau,Tristan Cazenave,Éric Piette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents GRAVE2, GRAVER, and GRAVER2, memory-efficient extensions of the GRAVE Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm that maintain similar playing strength while drastically reducing stored nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRAVE is a powerful MCTS variant for General Game Playing but is impractical in memory-constrained environments because it needs extra win/visit statistics per node, inflating memory usage. There is a need for variants that retain its strength while using far less memory so they can be deployed in real-world, resource-limited settings.

Method: The authors propose three algorithmic extensions of GRAVE: GRAVE2, which adds a two-level search scheme; GRAVER, which introduces node recycling to reuse and overwrite parts of the tree instead of continuously growing it; and GRAVER2, which combines both two-level search and node recycling. They compare these new variants to the original GRAVE in terms of node count and playing strength.

Result: All three new algorithms significantly reduce the number of stored nodes compared with GRAVE. Despite the aggressive memory savings, their empirical evaluation shows that the playing strength of these variants matches that of the original GRAVE algorithm.

Conclusion: By incorporating two-level search and node recycling, GRAVE2, GRAVER, and GRAVER2 make GRAVE-like MCTS methods practical in memory-constrained environments. They demonstrate that it is possible to drastically cut memory usage (stored nodes) without sacrificing playing performance in General Game Playing.

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

### [115] [Toward Expert Investment Teams:A Multi-Agent LLM System with Fine-Grained Trading Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23330)
*Kunihiro Miyazaki,Takanobu Kawahara,Stephen Roberts,Stefan Zohren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They build a multi-agent LLM trading system that breaks investment analysis into fine-grained tasks and show it boosts risk-adjusted returns versus coarse-grained LLM agents on Japanese stocks, especially when intermediate analyses are aligned with final decision preferences, and further improves via portfolio optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based autonomous trading systems commonly mimic roles like analyst and manager but work with high-level, abstract prompts. This misses the detailed, stepwise nature of actual investment workflows, which can hurt performance and reduce transparency. The authors aim to bridge this gap by making the agent workflow more realistic and controllable, and to systematically test whether finer task decomposition and better alignment between intermediate analyses and final trading decisions leads to better trading outcomes.

Method: They design a multi-agent LLM trading framework where the overall investment process is decomposed into fine-grained analytical tasks instead of a single coarse instruction per role. Agents process diverse Japanese equity data (prices, financial statements, news, macro indicators). They run leakage-controlled backtests to evaluate performance and compare fine-grained vs coarse-grained agent designs. They analyze intermediate agent outputs to study how well analytical signals align with ultimate trading decisions and how that affects performance. They then apply classical portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of different systems’ outputs, to construct improved portfolios.

Result: The fine-grained task-decomposed multi-agent LLM system delivers significantly higher risk-adjusted returns than traditional coarse-grained designs in backtests on Japanese stocks. Analysis reveals that systems where intermediate analytical outputs are better aligned with downstream decision preferences perform better, indicating this alignment is a key performance driver. Additionally, when they perform portfolio optimization using correlations with the index and output variance across systems, they obtain portfolios that outperform baselines, achieving superior overall trading performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly decomposing investment analysis into fine-grained LLM-driven tasks improves both performance and interpretability in autonomous trading systems relative to coarse-grained multi-agent structures. Ensuring strong alignment between intermediate analyses and final trading decisions is crucial for maximizing system performance. Furthermore, combining such LLM-based strategies through standard portfolio optimization, taking advantage of diversification benefits, can further enhance returns. These insights provide practical guidance for designing agent architectures and task setups when deploying LLM agents in real-world trading settings.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.
