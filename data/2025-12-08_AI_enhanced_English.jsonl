We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production.

So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper argues, via a formal proof, that algorithms (and thus AI models) cannot generate genuinely new functional capabilities beyond what is already implicitly contained in their original design, so artificial general intelligence as \u2018truly creative innovation\u2019 is unattainable for machine computation.", "motivation": "Growing progress in AI has sparked debate about whether artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014often associated with human\u2011level, genuinely creative intelligence\u2014is achievable. The authors want to move beyond informal speculation and provide a rigorous, computation\u2011theoretic answer by setting fundamental upper bounds on what any algorithmic system can do, specifically with respect to creativity and innovation.", "method": "The authors adopt an operational definition of AGI from prior work: the capability to create innovations in some domain that unlock genuinely new and previously unknown functional capabilities. Using this definition, they construct a formal argument (likely based on properties of algorithms and computability theory) to show that an algorithm\u2019s behavior is fully determined by its initial specification and cannot introduce fundamentally new functional capabilities not already encoded\u2014explicitly or implicitly\u2014in that specification.", "result": "They derive a formal upper bound: no algorithm can exhibit functional capabilities that were not already present, in some form, in the original algorithm. Consequently, algorithms\u2014and by extension contemporary and future AI models\u2014cannot satisfy the adopted definition of \u2018true creativity\u2019 as the generation of genuinely new functional capabilities. They can only recombine, permute, or reveal capabilities that are already embedded in their design and training data.", "conclusion": "Under the chosen definition of AGI, machine\u2011computable processes are provably incapable of true creativity: they cannot originate genuinely new functional capabilities, only manifest existing ones and their combinations. This implies that AGI, in the strong sense used here, is unattainable by any purely algorithmic system. The paper closes by reflecting on how this constraint shapes expectations for future AI research and raises questions about how human intelligence, which appears to exhibit such creativity, might arise from mechanisms that go beyond standard algorithmic computation."}}

The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition.

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218.

Recent advances in Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for solving (W)PMS have mainly focused on designing clause weighting schemes.

In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types.

MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897. These results demonstrate that the proposed agent captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a multimodal AI agent that predicts IDH1 mutation status in low-grade glioma by combining histology image features with structured clinical and genomic data plus external biomedical knowledge, achieving higher F1-scores than using histology or clinical data alone.", "motivation": "IDH1 mutation status is a crucial biomarker in low-grade gliomas with important prognostic and therapeutic implications, yet existing prediction methods typically rely on single data modalities (e.g., histology alone or clinical/genomic data alone). There is a need for models that can integrate heterogeneous patient data and external biomedical knowledge to more accurately infer mutation status and support precision oncology. This work aims to address that gap by building an agent that reasons over multiple modalities and knowledge sources.", "method": "The authors design a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) that integrates: (1) a histology prediction tool based on the TITAN foundation model to extract image-derived features relevant to IDH1 mutation; and (2) a reasoning component that consumes structured clinical and genomic variables together with information retrieved from external biomedical resources such as PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB. They evaluate MOA on 488 TCGA-LGG patients, comparing variants of the agent (with and without histology features) against baseline models using only clinical data, only histology, or fused histology-clinical features. Performance is measured primarily by F1-score for IDH1 mutation prediction.", "result": "On the TCGA-LGG cohort, MOA without the histology tool already surpasses the clinical baseline, with an F1-score of 0.826 versus 0.798. When histology features from the TITAN-based tool are fused into MOA, performance further improves, reaching an F1-score of 0.912. This outperforms the histology-only baseline (0.894) and the fused histology-clinical baseline (0.897), indicating that MOA leverages complementary information from multimodal data and external knowledge sources to improve IDH1 mutation prediction.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that the proposed Multimodal Oncology Agent effectively integrates histology, structured clinical/genomic data, and external biomedical knowledge to enhance prediction of IDH1 mutation status in low-grade glioma. Its superior F1-score relative to strong baselines suggests that such agent-based, knowledge-enriched multimodal approaches can capture mutation-relevant signals that single-modality or simple fusion models miss, supporting more accurate molecular characterization and potentially better-informed clinical decision-making in neuro-oncology."}}
