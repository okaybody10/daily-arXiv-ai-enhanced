It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied.

Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper quantitatively demonstrates a strong structural divide between AI safety and AI ethics research communities using large-scale bibliometric and co-authorship analysis, and argues for institutional and methodological integration to build AI systems that are both robust and just.", "motivation": "AI capabilities are rapidly scaling, increasing the urgency of alignment research.

When these key \u201cbroker\u201d papers and their associated authors are removed from the collaboration network, measures of segregation increase sharply, indicating that most cross-community exchange is funneled through a small, non-representative set of actors instead of being broadly distributed across the field.

This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents.

Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query.

These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper critiques how AI and language technologies handle low-resource languages, using Serbian as a case, and proposes a CARE-based \u201cData Care\u201d framework for more ethical, culturally grounded corpus and model development.", "motivation": "To understand how structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shape language technology for low-resource languages, and to critique the dominance of English-centric, engineering-first AI approaches that overlook linguistic and cultural nuance, especially for Serbian.", "method": "Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with ten experts (linguists, digital humanists, AI developers), analyzing their perspectives on the challenges of developing language technologies for Serbian and similar low-resource languages.", "result": "The study identifies key problems: historical loss of Serbian textual heritage; reliance on English-trained models; superficial transliteration practices; data and sampling biases; and corpus/dataset design that lacks cultural and linguistic specificity, leading to reductive, functionality-first solutions that reproduce power imbalances and blind spots.", "conclusion": "The authors propose \u201cData Care,\u201d grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics), as a framework that embeds bias mitigation into corpus design, annotation, and governance from the outset, offering a replicable, more inclusive and sustainable model for building language technologies for low-resource languages in the AI age."}}

While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfoCom is an information-theoretic, communication-efficient collaborative perception framework for autonomous driving that reduces inter-vehicle data from MB to KB while maintaining near-lossless perception performance.", "motivation": "Autonomous vehicles need precise environmental perception, but single-agent perception is limited by occlusions, sensor range, and viewpoint. Collaborative perception can alleviate this by sharing information between agents (e.g., vehicles), but practical networks cannot reliably support the megabyte-level data commonly assumed by existing methods for every collaboration step. There is a need for a principled way to minimize communication while preserving task-relevant information, rather than heuristically compressing or pruning features.", "method": "The paper proposes InfoCom, an information-aware collaborative perception framework grounded in an extended Information Bottleneck (IB) formulation. Instead of conventional feature-level compression or selection, InfoCom uses an information purification paradigm to extract minimal sufficient statistics for the perception task under IB constraints. It consists of three key components: (i) Information-Aware Encoding, which learns to compress intermediate features into compact messages that retain maximal task-relevant information while discarding redundancy; (ii) Sparse Mask Generation, which produces lightweight spatial masks that indicate where collaboration is beneficial, incurring negligible communication overhead; and (iii) Multi-Scale Decoding, which reconstructs and aggregates shared information in a progressive, mask-guided way, focusing decoding capacity on informative regions instead of naive feature reconstruction across the whole scene.", "result": "Experiments on multiple autonomous driving and collaborative perception datasets show that InfoCom preserves almost the same perception accuracy as high-bandwidth baselines (near-lossless performance), while dramatically reducing communication cost. The method brings communication from megabyte-scale to kilobyte-scale per agent, achieving about a 440\u00d7 reduction compared with Where2comm and about a 90\u00d7 reduction compared with ERMVP, without significant degradation in perception metrics.", "conclusion": "InfoCom demonstrates that an information-theoretic, IB-based design can break the conventional communication-performance trade-off in collaborative perception for autonomous driving. By purifying and selectively sharing only minimal task-critical information and using mask-guided multi-scale decoding, it enables practical, low-bandwidth collaboration while maintaining high perception quality. This establishes a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for future communication-efficient multi-agent perception systems."}}

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset.

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL.

Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

This study investigates the robustness of these \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping \"Reject\" decisions to \"Accept,\" for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like \"Maximum Mark Magyk\" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models.

To measure robustness in a task-relevant way, they introduce a new metric called WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score), which captures how effectively attacks can flip a negative (reject) decision into a positive (accept) one. They systematically test obfuscation and injection tactics, such as the \"Maximum Mark Magyk\" method, and quantify decision flip rates for each model and attack type.", "result": "The experiments show that many LLM-as-a-judge systems are highly susceptible to adversarial PDF manipulation. Certain obfuscation-based attacks\u2014particularly the \"Maximum Mark Magyk\" strategy\u2014can significantly alter review scores and, in many cases, flip overall decisions from reject to accept, even for advanced large models.

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a hardware-aware neural architecture search framework to automatically design early-exit networks with optimized exit branches, improving accuracy at equal or lower computational cost (MACs) compared to prior methods.", "motivation": "Early-exit networks can reduce energy and latency by allowing easy samples to exit early, which is crucial for resource-constrained devices.

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

It bridges the gap between offline RL\u2019s data-driven nature and CBF\u2019s formal safety guarantees, reducing reliance on expert-designed barriers or accurate models. The study suggests that value-guided, expectile-based learning of neural CBFs, combined with QP-based control, is an effective approach to enforce forward invariance and real-time safety in autonomous systems trained purely from logged demonstrations."}}

It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.", "AI": {"tldr": "A computational multi-agent setup with a \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018daughter\u2019 language model is used to show that abstract grammatical categories and rules can be learned from surface utterances alone via clustering-based analysis.", "motivation": "To investigate how abstract grammatical knowledge (like categories and rules) can emerge in a learner that only observes language use, without access to the internal representations of a proficient speaker or handcrafted grammar, and to provide a controlled \u2018computational laboratory\u2019 for studying language acquisition mechanisms.", "method": "They implement a multi-agent system with two language models: an adult (mother) model that generates utterances and a learner (daughter) model that observes these utterances. The daughter performs statistical analysis on the input, specifically hierarchical agglomerative clustering over the sequence of utterances produced by the mother, to identify recurring patterns that correspond to grammatical categories. From the resulting clusters, they derive discrete grammatical rules, which are then incorporated into the daughter\u2019s internal grammar. They then validate the learned parameter configuration in a second experiment on a separate test set produced by the mother model.", "result": "The clustering-based analysis of the mother model\u2019s output yields structured clusters that map onto linguistically plausible grammatical categories. From these, the system induces explicit grammatical rules and adds them to the daughter model\u2019s grammar. In both training and test experiments, the daughter model acquires non-trivial grammatical categories from exemplars alone, indicating that the method generalizes beyond the original training data.", "conclusion": "The study shows that a learner agent can acquire abstract, linguist-like grammatical categories and rules solely from exposure to another agent\u2019s utterances using hierarchical clustering and statistical pattern analysis. This supports the feasibility of using such computational laboratory environments to explore mechanisms of language acquisition and suggests that significant grammatical structure can emerge from distributional information without direct access to a teacher\u2019s internal grammar."}}
