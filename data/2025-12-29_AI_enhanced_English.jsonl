This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.\n  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper analyzes why prior attempts at teaching users LLM failure patterns did not sufficiently reduce overreliance and shows that such teaching can work if failures are better discovered and more appropriate evaluation metrics are used.", "motivation": "Users often overtrust LLMs even on tasks where these models are unreliable, partly because impressive capabilities on complex tasks make them seem competent on simple ones.

With reliable methods to identify failure-prone regions of the input space and with metrics that capture users\u2019 improved error anticipation, teaching failure patterns emerges as a promising strategy to mitigate overreliance on LLMs."}}

Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.\n  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed \"world\" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a unified, world-model-based definition of hallucination in language models and uses it to guide evaluation benchmarks and mitigation strategies.", "motivation": "Hallucinations in neural and large language models persist despite many mitigation attempts, partly because the term is inconsistently defined across the literature. This lack of a shared conceptual framework makes it hard to compare results, design robust evaluations, or understand what is actually being fixed. The authors aim to resolve this by providing a single, coherent definition that subsumes prior ones and clarifies what counts as hallucination versus other error types.", "method": "The authors conduct a conceptual and historical analysis of how hallucination has been defined in prior work. They abstract these definitions into a unified framework where hallucination is framed as inaccurate internal world modeling made externally observable. Key dimensions are the choice of reference world model (e.g., knowledge base, source document, environment) and the policy for conflict resolution among knowledge sources (e.g., KB vs. in-context information). They then use this framework to propose a design for new benchmarks built on synthetic, fully specified world models.", "result": "They obtain a single, unified definition of hallucination that generalizes many previous definitions as special cases, depending on the reference world and conflict policy. Using this definition, they distinguish hallucinations from other failures such as planning mistakes or reward-driven behavior that does not reflect mis-modeled world knowledge. They also outline a benchmark family in which hallucinations are precisely defined as mismatches between a model\u2019s outputs and a fully known synthetic world, allowing systematic stress-testing of world modeling capabilities.", "conclusion": "Hallucination in language models is best understood as inaccurate internal world modeling that becomes visible in the model\u2019s outputs relative to a specified source of truth. Making the assumed world model and conflict policy explicit clarifies evaluation, improves comparability of benchmarks and mitigation methods, and avoids conflating hallucinations with other error modes. Synthetic, fully specified worlds offer a principled way to build benchmarks that directly probe and enhance the world modeling components of language models."}}

They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues.

These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents.

Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions.

The trisected categorizations of agents, issues, and agent pairs lead to more nuanced identification of alliances, conflicts, and neutralities in multi-issue settings.

Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents.

To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized.

By focusing on their respective specialized capabilities and engaging in collaborative interactions, these LoRAs collectively accomplish the agent task. 3) To effectively fine-tune the framework, we develop a multi-role data generation pipeline based on publicly available datasets, incorporating role-specific content completion and reliability verification.

In shortcut experiments on MMLU and HotpotQA, models using COCONUT systematically exploit dataset artifacts and shortcuts, maintaining or inflating performance in ways that do not generalize under distribution shifts, exposing a lack of true reasoning ability.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that COCONUT should not be seen as a faithful latent reasoning mechanism. Instead, it behaves as a pseudo-reasoning method: its latent tokens produce plausible reasoning-like traces while mainly encoding shortcut strategies tied to dataset artifacts. This challenges claims that COCONUT yields both efficiency and reliable reasoning, and calls for more robust methods and evaluations of latent token-based reasoning in LLMs."}}

SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs.

We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores.

Here, the term \"statute\" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms.

This paradigm requires scalable and reliable collection of unit test cases to provide accurate feedback, and the resulting feedback is often sparse and cannot effectively distinguish between trajectories that are both successful or both unsuccessful. In contrast, execution-free feedback from reward models can provide more fine-grained signals without depending on unit test cases. Despite this potential, execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering (SWE) agents remains underexplored. Aiming to develop versatile reward models that are effective across TTS and RL, however, we observe that two verifiers with nearly identical TTS performance can nevertheless yield very different results in RL. Intuitively, TTS primarily reflects the model's ability to select the best trajectory, but this ability does not necessarily generalize to RL. To address this limitation, we identify two additional aspects that are crucial for RL training: classification accuracy and calibration. We then conduct comprehensive controlled experiments to investigate how to train a robust reward model that performs well across these metrics. In particular, we analyze the impact of various factors such as training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Guided by these investigations, we introduce SWE-RM, an accurate and robust reward model adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference. SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. For example, it increases the accuracy of Qwen3-Coder-Flash from 51.6% to 62.0%, and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes SWE-RM, a large, execution-free reward model that provides fine-grained feedback for software engineering agents, improving both test-time scaling and RL training and achieving state-of-the-art results on SWE-Bench Verified.", "motivation": "Current coding agents mostly rely on execution-based feedback via unit tests for test-time scaling and RL.

This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of \"natural\" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits \"martial\" into \"mart\" and \"ial\"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how \"bad\" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper argues that when LLM tokenizers split natural words into multiple subword tokens, it can hurt model performance, and introduces penalty functions to measure how problematic a given tokenization is, then validates this on several NLP tasks and models.", "motivation": "LLMs use subword tokenization with fixed vocabularies, which often splits a single natural word into multiple tokens.

They perform statistical tests to determine if higher penalties are significantly associated with worse performance.", "result": "Across multiple NLP tasks and different LLMs, they find a statistically significant negative relationship between tokenization quality (as captured by their penalty measures) and model performance. Texts or vocabularies that result in more frequent or severe splitting of natural words tend to show worse LLM performance, and these trends are robust under their statistical analysis.", "conclusion": "The work supports the hypothesis that breaking natural words into multiple tokens can harm LLM performance and that this effect can be quantified via their proposed penalty functions.

Although its utility is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms of self-attention underlying its advanced learning and the quantitative characterization of this learning process remains an open research question. This study introduces a new approach for quantifying information processing within the self-attention mechanism. The analysis conducted on the BERT-12 architecture reveals that, in the final layers, the attention map focuses on sentence separator tokens, suggesting a practical approach to text segmentation based on semantic features. Based on the vector space emerging from the self-attention heads, a context similarity matrix, measuring the scalar product between two token vectors was derived, revealing distinct similarities between different token vector pairs within each head and layer. The findings demonstrated that different attention heads within an attention block focused on different linguistic characteristics, such as identifying token repetitions in a given text or recognizing a token of common appearance in the text and its surrounding context. This specialization is also reflected in the distribution of distances between token vectors with high similarity as the architecture progresses. The initial attention layers exhibit substantially long-range similarities; however, as the layers progress, a more short-range similarity develops, culminating in a preference for attention heads to create strong similarities within the same sentence. Finally, the behavior of individual heads was analyzed by examining the uniqueness of their most common tokens in their high similarity elements. Each head tends to focus on a unique token from the text and builds similarity pairs centered around it.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper quantitatively analyzes how self-attention in BERT processes information, showing head-wise specialization, evolving from long-range to local (sentence-level) similarities, and a focus on separator tokens for semantic segmentation.", "motivation": "While self-attention is known to be powerful in NLP models like BERT, the exact internal mechanisms, especially how information is processed and represented across layers and heads, are not well understood.

They then analyze attention maps (e.g., where attention mass is placed, such as on separator tokens), similarity patterns between token pairs, and the distribution of distances between highly similar token vectors across layers. They also inspect which specific tokens each head most strongly associates (high-similarity pairs) to infer functional specialization.", "result": "They find that in higher layers, attention maps strongly focus on sentence separator tokens, indicating that the model implicitly segments text semantically. Different heads specialize in distinct linguistic roles, such as detecting repeated tokens or tokens that commonly appear with certain contexts.

Each head tends to anchor on a particular token type or specific token and builds similarity structures around it.", "conclusion": "Self-attention in BERT exhibits clear, quantifiable specialization across heads and layers. Early layers capture broad, long-range relationships, whereas later layers focus on local and sentence-level structure, often mediated by separator tokens. Individual heads act as specialized detectors centered on particular tokens or linguistic phenomena. The proposed similarity-based analysis framework offers a way to interpret and quantify these internal processes of self-attention."}}

We propose CAT, a new context management paradigm that elevates context maintenance to a callable tool integrated into the decision-making process of agents. CAT formalizes a structured context workspace consisting of stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, and high-fidelity short-term interactions, and enables agents to proactively compress historical trajectories into actionable summaries at appropriate milestones. To support context management for SWE-agents, we propose a trajectory-level supervision framework, CAT-GENERATOR, based on an offline data construction pipeline that injects context-management actions into complete interaction trajectories. Using this framework, we train a context-aware model, SWE-Compressor.
